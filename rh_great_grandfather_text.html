              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
              day I finally located the photograph of my great great
              grandfather John Hill, seven years of part-time hobbying in
              genealogy were rewarded with a rare chance to glimpse again a
              remarkable, pioneering member of my family born in 1798.</font>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the first
              photographs were taken in France in 1839 using the daguerrotype
              process, it seemed highly unlikely that I would ever find a
              photograph of him. The photograph which I finally unearthed
              shows a man with deep set eyes staring straight at the camera.
              His full beard is bushy and grey at the edges, yet strangely
              black on the chin. A bold, black moustache underpins a forceful,
              aquiline nose.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; When John Hill
              left Bristol in the <i>Ward Chipman</i> on 21 March 1840 he was
              headed for the Port Phillip District in the Colony of New South
              Wales. Separation had not taken place and Victoria would not be
              created as a separate colony until 1850. Sailing with him was
              his wife Naomi and their sons John, Rowland, William, Edward and
              Henry. They arrived in Port Phillip on 16 December 1840.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The journey took
              nearly nine months and the ship's captain, in a report to His
              Excellency C.J. La Trobe, hints at the problems on that long
              trip. In Melbourne on 4 January 1841 he wrote regarding payment
              of bounty to the ship's owner William Williams of Bristol:<br>
              <i>. . . if the immigrants had experienced proper treatment
              during the voyage, but as the enquiry on that subject is still
              sub-judice, we refrain from further comment on that particular</i>.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The shipping
              records show that John was 38 at the time and his calling is
              recorded as a Carpenter/Sawyer. His wife Naomi was 37. They were
              each paid a bounty of 19 pounds for migrating, whilst the five
              sons were paid a total of 50 pounds between them.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Writing a few
              years ago, my mother's aunt told of her father, John junior aged
              16, talking of helping with the rationing of water on the ship
              during the nine month voyage.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>They were nearly a fortnight
              coming up Port Phillip Bay. When they slowly made their way up
              the river, on which sides, numbers of stark naked blacks jumped
              around and slapped their rumps at us. His mother gathered the
              little ones around her and wept</i>.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1841 the
              population of Port Phillip District was 20,416. By the time John
              Hill died on 26 May 1866, aged 68 years, the population had
              risen to 633,602.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; As I stood
              admiring his red granite tombstone in the pioneer's section of
              the Burwood Cemetery I thought that there might be another
              tangible record of his pioneering life in Port Phillip Colony
              apart from this imposing five metre high memorial.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Browsing through <i>The Story
              of the Camera in Australia</i> by Jack Cato, one day at the
              Nunawading Library, I found the clue which set me in search of
              great great grandfather's photograph. Cato relates how Thomas
              Foster Chuck set about photographing the Colony of Victoria's
              first explorers, pioneers and settlers who were still alive
              around 1864.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; When Chuck
              completed the task of photographing as many of the pioneers as
              he could the result became a huge mosaic standing nearly two
              metres high.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The
              book said the mosaic was stored in the basement of the State
              Library. It contains over 1,000 portraits and is titled <i>The
              explorers and early colonists of Victoria</i>. There are no
              women acknowledged as pioneers. The portraits are numbered, and
              there is an accompanying key for identification.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; A quick phone call
              to the helpful staff at the La Trobe Library confirmed that this
              large slice of Victoria's early history still exists and that an
              index is available to check the names of all the pioneers Chuck
              photographed. My great great grandfather John Hill is No. 709 and a
              search at the La Trobe Library showed him gazing out among his
              fellow pioneers. If you have a member of your family among the
              group you can purchase a print of that section of the mosaic for
              a nominal sum.</font></p>

              exciting hobby which more and more people are undertaking as
              Australia moves towards celebrating its 200th in 1988.&nbsp;</font>

              The Macquarie Dictionary definition of genealogy as '... an account
              of the descent of a person or family through an ancestral line',
              does not prepare one for the surprises and delights which await
              the keen genealogist tracking back through old records, files,
              family Bibles and letters.</font>

              genealogy is quite simple. You just need to start with yourself
              and then start tracking back through all the available public
              records. When I set out to find out all about my family and our
              forbears I began by writing down all the details from my own

              your parents and your mother's maiden surname. From there you
              just need to work back through successive generations as far as
              you can find records.</font></p>
