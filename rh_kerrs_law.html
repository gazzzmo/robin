        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">SOME OF the loudest and ugliest street
        scenes in Melbourne for years were seen on wednesday night when
        Australia's current govenor general sir John Kerr went to dinner. Even
        sir John looked shocked at the ferocity of the demonstration.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; In a punchpacked evening
        involving about 1000 yelling, screaming, chanting men and women, tempers
        toppled as frustrated demonstrators realised they were outmaneuvered by the victorian police who seemed to have learned their
        tactical lesson after the debacle outside the Royal Commonwealth society
        two weeks earlier.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Twelve people were
        arrested and two girls were injured: one girl was trampled by a police
        horse and another had a foot run over by a taxi carrying dinner guests
        which accelerated in an attempt to plough a path through the demonstrators blocking Wallen road just up from the Leonda restaurant,
        venue for the dinner. Guests walking through the demonstrators were
        pushed, jostled, spat upon and had various missiles thrown at them.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; When the first
        demonstrators arrived late in the afternoon they found that police had
        closed off over two kilometres of one of Melbourne's busiest arterial
        roads, Swan street, on the city side of the Yarra and were not allowing
        any pedestrian or vehicular traffic through until a couple of hundred metres
        beyond the Leonda where the name changes to Wallen road. Police were
        also lining the Yarra riverfront behind the Leonda and had a patrol boat
        on the river.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition the police
        diverted all traffic for a radius of four kilometres around the Leonda.
        Reliable sources indicate that almost 500 police were involved in the
        complete operation.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, a heavy
        rumour had been spread that Kerr would not be coming to the dinner from
        the direction of Melbourne so the majority of the demonstrators were at
        the Hawthorn end to greet him and missed the opportunity. Staff of
        Melbourne TV stations had been given
        the same misinformation and missed being able to film his arrival at
        the Leonda except from a distance. Their night floodlamps were all set up in the wrong direction.
        </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> As each person was
        arrested they were taken to the rear of a paddy wagon,
        photographed at least twice by a police photographer and then placed in the
        wagon.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; When sir John Kerr's car arrived at 6.48 pm demonstrators nearest the
        Leonda tried to push forward but the solid line of police stood firm.
        Smoke bombs&nbsp; were&nbsp;&nbsp; then&nbsp;&nbsp; thrown&nbsp; in&nbsp;
        rapid&nbsp;</font></p>

        at&nbsp;police horses directly behind the police line. Marbles were also
        thrown under the horses hooves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
        The girl injured by the police horse was hurt as a group of mounted
        police rode into a crowd of demonstrators trying to block the path of
        sir John's car. Kerr's car was dented when a young demonstrator threw a
        banner pole at it. Police horses backing into the Rolls, as they tried
        to force demonstrators back, kicked dents in door panels. It is alleged
        that police seized a knife from a young demonstrator just before sir
        John arrived.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; A
        walkout on sir John Kerr had been planned to take place during the law
        institute dinner by young radical lawyers. I understand that the old boy
        network made it known to members of the Young Lawyers association that
        if they attempted a walkout or any other form of protests against sir
        John it would not be forgotten, and would be a heavy hindrance to their
        progress in the profession.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Following
        this velvet glove approach, a number of radical lawyers decided not to
        attend the $16 a head dinner at the Leonda and instead joined the
        demonstrators behind the barricades to indicate their feelings.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Before sir John left the dinner the president of the National Australia
        Association, Alex Psalti, issued a statement in which he called for
        demonstrators to be conscripted. As sir John left the dinner a bottle
        smashed against his car.</font></p>

        Note: On November 11, 1975 the Governor General Sir John Kerr dismissed
        Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister and installed Malcolm Fraser as a
        &quot;caretaker&quot; Prime Minister. This started a cycle of
        demonstrations against the Governor General which continued for months
        until he was driven from office. This was one of the most volatile and
        frightening demonstrations against Kerr which Robin covered. At one
        stage during the evening he was almost knocked down by a police horse.</font>
