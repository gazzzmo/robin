                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
                Down Under BBS started with a dream in 1978 - in fact it was a
                Dream 6800 kit computer, built by Greg Hudson when he was 24
                years old.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It had a
                massive 1 K memory,&quot; he recalls. &quot;All programming had
                to be done in hex and there was no external storage. So when you
                switched it off you had to be ready to program it again.&quot;
                Now, users of the Down Under BBS know that each time they log on
                they might find a new feature carefully written into the
                program. The main menu often offers a surprise.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I decided
                to start the BBS on August 4, 1985 for the public benefit,&quot;
                Hudson says. &quot;I chose the name, Down Under, because I was
                selling software in the US and wanted a distinctively Australian
                name&quot;. The software was <i>Star Trek Adventure</i>, a text
                file adventure game with fine graphics, written by him
                originally for the TRS 80. It was adapted first for the Peach
                computer and at $15 is a bargain for the IBM PC and compatibles.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; In less than a
                year the Down Under BBS has attracted between 40 and 50 users
                each day, with a few more at weekends. There are around 360
                regular users and over 600 irregular users. Only 13 women use
                the board. Most people spend between 20 to 30 minutes on the
                BBS. If you do not manage to log on at your first call, keep
                dialling!</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Hudson has added
                15K of source code to the original 35K program running the Down
                Under code to the original BBS to support a host of original
                features. The improved program has been turned into a standard
                ASCII BASIC file, which is still under 30K for the whole BBS
                because it is compiled. In the downloadable files area,
                selective directories are available including Communication,
                Finance, Games, Music, Newfiles, Pictures, Unprotection and
                Utility categories.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                board is used to promote products which Down Under Software has
                for sale, plus special monthly deals.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The main users are
                businessmen and students from the Royal Melbourne Institute of
                Technology. Asked to predict developments in BBS here in the
                next two years, Hudson is not modest. &quot;They'll just have to
                keep up to me,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm in the process of
                writing a multi-user interface with the Down Under BBS. It will
                have an interactive chat mode. I believe that is not available
                on any other BBS in Australia at the moment.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; When this feature
                is added, three people at a time (two external users and the
                sysop using a local console) will be able to use it. However,
                Hudson is planning to expand it with 10 Telecom lines.&nbsp;</font></p>

                two outputs to run color and monochrome monitors simultaneously,
                two Chinon 360K floppy disk drives and a 22M Tandon hard disk. A

                access became available). Down Under BBS has probably become so
                popular because it is continually evolving. Like a Vegemite
                sandwich, it is distinctly Australian, and very addictive.</font></p>
