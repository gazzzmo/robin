        it's the<br>
        <i>Woman's day</i> lensman</b></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">HELLO DARLINGS, I've
        just managed to attend the glittering world premiere of Margaret Fink's
        production of <i>The removalists</i>. There were so many stars and top
        people at the premiere it was a pleasure to be in attendance with so
        many of her relatives. Margaret must come from a big close family.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Even as I
        arrived at Hoyt's cinema centre in Melbourne's Bourke street I realised
        it was going to be another wunderbar evening. <i>Woman's day's</i>
        photographer was actually waiting on the footpath to record my arrival.
        Darling lad, Les.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of
        the beautiful people were standing around in the foyer hoping that they
        would be noticed by the horrid social writers for those common mass
        circulation sheets (God knows why). They didnt dare go inside until they
        were seen and the show was 20 minutes late starting. V. tiring.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to
        make my way through the foyer I noticed that delightful chap Harold de
        Marigny. Harold is quite an identity in Melbourne because he always
        seems to be wearing a panama hat. I've heard it suggested that he even
        wears it under the shower. Naturally, <i>I</i> can't vouch for such an
        amazing story.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenants of
        the housing commission of Victoria who are behind in their rent might
        need to watch out with the nasty tips Harold the Hat may have picked up
        from <i>The removalists</i> . . . because harold is their public
        relations officer.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Although
        the invitations specified &quot;black tie&quot; I was pleased to see
        that jeweller&nbsp; Matcham Skipper from Montsalvat country came dressed
        in casual skivvy, slacks and Eltham mudcaked boots. That man is
        unbelievably masculine.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Didnt see
        my dear friend Vi Greenandahalf MBE. I can only assume that she wasnt
        invited so that Margaret Fink could invite two more of her cousins to
        see the film. Pity, because I was looking forward to more of Vi's witty
        repartee. She was absolutely brilliant at the premiere of <i>Scobie
        Malone</i> last fortnight. She told us how she came home from GTV9 the
        other day with &quot;drippy drawers&quot;. Isnt she priceless? She got
        an MBE last week. Bravo Vi!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Waved to
        Alan Finney, late of <i>Flicks</i> fame with ABC TV. Alan looked spiffy
        in a rusty red two piece suit and a bold brown &amp; white striped shirt
        open at the collar. Hope MF didnt notice he didnt have a black tie. I
        suppose if you work for the Roadshow/Village theatre group as Alan does
        you dont have to care what you wear to a Fink feature.</font></td>

      <td valign="top" align="left" width="345">
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Verdana" size="2">After
        Margaret's movie had successfully set us ablaze, we all trouped across
        to the Southern Cross hotel for a champers supper. Isnt MF lucky that
        her husband Leon - who wasnt one of the Sydney &quot;Push&quot; -
        controls the firm that owns the Southern Cross? As I said: a big, close
        family.</font></p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Verdana" size="2">Entering
        the Southern Cross ballroom I knew I was at a truly glittering occasion.
        My dears, the chandelier has to be seen to be believed. Brilliant. And
        all those super trendy Kentia palms seem to absolutely thrive on the
        dregs of so much champagne.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; MF's man
        Leon certainly didnt stint on the champers. It was flowing like water
        and like everyone else I did get a bit tiddly. But not before I noted
        who the best dressed people in the ballroom were.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; It really
        was Margaret Fink's night. She stole the attention with her beautifully
        cut long black gown with blue embroidery. Simple but so chic and it
        moulded her figure lovingly. Margaret's daughter Hannah, although just
        12, was a close runner up. Hannah wore a batik dress with a swirl skirt
        and looked to be enjoying herself immensely. After Hannah, I couldnt
        help noting Margaret's cousin May. May so fey. May so gay. May with her
        black dress with her beautiful bodice embroidered with paillettes. May
        wearing her black beaded bandeau. May and her strikingly beautiful cape
        of soft orange ostrich feathers.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Then two
        beautiful flower children caught my eye. Being so shy I wasnt able to
        ask their names. he was wearing a white suit, red shirt and a patriotic
        nosegay. She wore a green skirt, green embroidered silk shawl pinned
        around her shoulders with a gardenia. She didnt seem to be wearing
        anything under the shawl. But it didnt seem to matter.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; That well
        known PR person around town, Barry Balmer, was wearing a blue grey
        dinner suit with a thoroughly elegant bow tie. Barry also had his well
        loved silver chain around his neck. Now if only that chain could talk!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Also seen
        were Claudia, Peter Couchman, Evelyn Krape, Bruce Spence, Phillipa
        Finney, David Williamson, the queen of the groupies, Max Spence, Brioney
        Behets, Geoff Manion and Marion Ballieu.</font></p>
