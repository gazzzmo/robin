                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">MOVES AIMED at
                preparing the way for Bob Hawke to obtain a safe seat in
                parliament are still continuing in Victoria. However they
                received a serious setback during last friday's meeting of the
                administrative committee of the Victorian ALP branch when a
                motion intended to make it easier for Hawke to stand was
                overwhelmingly defeated when the socialist left and the right
                groups combined to defeat it.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Strongly supported by state parliamentary leader Clyde Holding,
                the motion started by pointing out the obvious fact that due to
                the electoral system the Labor vote is concentrated in limited
                areas. It went on to say that this restricts the number of safe
                seats available to party members.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                After sweetening the pill by acknowledging that some
                parliamentarians had to make a big contribution to the movement
                it then said that a number of them had reached an age or a stage
                of their careers where their contribution to the ALP achieving
                government would be of limited significance.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The defeated motion concluded by calling on members of the
                federal and state parliament to seriously consider their
                positions.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Since Hawke has said that he would not stand against a sitting
                member it was thought that if this motion was passed it would
                provide an opportunity for him to seek endorsement for a safe
                seat.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Because there were some absentees from the centre/unity strength
                they did not have the all-important numbers to defeat the
                combined votes of the socialist left and the right on the motion
                that Holding saw as a means of preparing a path for Hawke's
                entry to federal parliament.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The defeated motion was part of the strategy to try to
                &quot;encourage&quot; a sitting ALP member to stand down prior
                to the 1978 elections.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Hawke's supporters in the Victorian branch including Clyde
                Holding, Bill Landeryou and Peter Redlich are all trying to get
                a seat for him as soon as possible. Their strategy is to get him
                into parliament quickly so that he can be eased into the shadow
                cabinet and be in a position where he can seek the leadership of
                the parliamentary party prior to the next federal elections.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                They're also hoping to get as many Hawke supporters as possible
                into federal parliament in the same election. It's reliably
                reported that candidates and potential candidates are being
                sounded out to see if they will support Hawke as ALP leader.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Another problem facing the &quot;Hawke for leader&quot; group
                involves his close friend and promoter Bill Landeryou.</font></td>

              <td valign="top" align="left" width="345">
                <p align="center"><img border="0" src="rh_hawkes_seat.jpg" width="316" height="351"></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Last friday it
                was pointed out that Landeryou is a member of two powerful
                Victorian ALP branch committees - administration and public
                selection. Under the rules of the branch he is allowed to be on
                only one committee and before the next administrative committee
                meeting next friday Landeryou must decide which one he will
                resign from while still retaining the maximum influence to
                benefit Hawke.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; I
                understand that Race Mathews, former member for Casey and now
                private secretary to Clyde Holding, has bought a home in the
                inner Melbourne suburb of North Fitzroy and plans to move there
                within two months from the outer eastern suburb of Croydon.
                Mathews confirms that he will not be seeking reendorsement for
                Casey because he will be outside the electorate.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; It
                also raises the possibility of him standing for Batman because
                he will soon be living in the electorate. When I put the
                question to him this week he assured me that he does not intend
                to seek ALP endorsement against the sitting member Horrie
                Garrick, who will be 60 by the time of the 1978 elections.
                Garrick has been the member for Batman since 1969 and it has
                been suggested a number of times that he could be
                &quot;encouraged&quot; to stand down to enable Hawke to enter
                parliament. So far Garrick has indicated that he is only
                interested in continuing his parliamentary duties.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Because he has been mayor of Collingwood twice and is a member
                of the Collingwood football club Garrick is well versed in the
                numbers game perfected in the rough and tumble atmosphere of
                Carringbush. When the first round of speculation started
                suggesting that Garrick would be moving aside in Batman for
                Hawke 28 out of the 30 Batman ALP branch members comprising the
                preselection panel signed letters to the national press
                criticising the speculation. They pointed out that whoever
                sought preselection for Batman would need local support and made
                it quite plain that they wouldnt welcome any attempts at having
                an outsider foisted on them.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Since he won the seat in 1969 Garrick has set up an office in
                the electorate and worked hard to increase the ALP majority. In
                1969 the ALP won 53 percent of the vote and by 1974 Garrick
                increased this to 61.4 percent. With that sort of performance he
                looks fairly safe.</font></td>
