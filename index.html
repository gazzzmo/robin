        <p>This personal copy of
        the first edition of his book was inscribed by Mike Leunig when he and
        Robin were colleagues together on Nation Review. At the time Robin was
        involved in a lot of pioneering investigative journalism. Taken from the
        frontispiece of &quot;The Penguin Leunig&quot; Introduced by Barry
        Humphries.<br>
