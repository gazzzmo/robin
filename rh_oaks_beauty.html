      <td valign="top" align="left" width="345"><img border="0" src="rh_oaks_beauty1.jpg" width="345" height="55"><br>
        <font face="Times New Roman" size="6"><b>Horses arse at<br>
        the Oaks</b></font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">EVERYBODY who's <i>anybody</i>
        goes to the Melbourne cup, dont they darlings? And of course any woman
        who wants to be <i>somebody</i> goes to Oaks day later that week.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; So even
        though the dreary Melbourne weather looked as though it was going to
        turn the tap on such a dazzling occasion I headed the Lambretta towards
        Flemington.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Right from
        the moment I swept on to the lawn with my lady friend Jennifer I
        realised Melbourne society people were not going to let a little cold
        rain spoil their parading.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; First
        person to catch my eagle eye was Ms William Gillespie of Bacchus Marsh
        who was amazingly well dressed in jockey silks. Now I've heard of people
        appearing in the all white colors of the club but Ms G. had a blue satin
        and gold horseshoe jacket which she wore with white cord tuck-in
        trousers and boots and a white jockey's cap.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Preening
        in public certainly does call for a certain panache and I must say that
        Lillian Frank (<i>compiled in collaboration with senior journalists</i>
        - as they say in Melbourne's <i>Sunday press</i>) certainly has it. Just
        as we entered the members' stand Lillian passed us on the stairs. She
        was wearing an exquisite leopard skin coat featuring black fur trim and
        a matching hat. A very sensible outfit considering the weather . . .
        even if she did look as if she would be more at home in the cat cage at
        the zoo. Under the coat Lill was wearing a black jersey frock drawn
        together in the middle. <i>Tres chic!</i></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Lovely
        little Delvene Delaney - who we all remember as the girl in the bikini
        selling Kodak film outside chemists - was the next filly to catch my
        eye. Didnt see her escort Strop or that boring Paul Hogan but couldnt
        miss D.D. She was showing off a mid length, lipstick pink suit which
        seemed to be symbolic of something.</font></td>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Samantha's
        best bet of the day went to the next person to catch her eye. Wearing a
        black kaftan with red tapestry sewn on to it, black boots and skivvy, a
        brass chain necklace and a tapestry shoulder bag, he was at least 6ft 2
        inches. I would have put good money on him at ten to one just for his
        potential staying power. An amazing young colt.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Even
        though the Oaks day is fillies day, I couldnt help seeing my old friend,
        Jon Finlayson. Jon was super trendy with his Zapata moustache and brown
        tweed cloth cap. He looked as if he was ready for a spot of
        &quot;flashing&quot;, too, with a spectacular black vinyl midlength
        coat.</font></p>
