        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DEMONSTRATORS
        throwing eggs, rocks and dye bombs at his Rolls-Royce were out in force
        when the governor general sir John Kerr came to Melbourne on wednesday
        night to be the guest of honor at a dinner of the royal commonwealth
        society. It was the first official visit sir John and lady Kerr had made
        to Melbourne since Whitlam's commission was withdrawn by Kerr last
        november and it provoked the most hostile demonstration against him
        since then:</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Although the Kerrs are not due to arrive until 8pm, a solid phalanx of
        demonstrators is gathered outside the RCS building an hour before. A
        thick forest of signs, placards and banners all reinforce the one
        message: sir John Kerr is disliked. Slogans include: <i>They shoot GGs
        dont they?</i>; <i>Stay out of politics Kerr</i>; and <i>Heil Kerr the
        distempered wretch. Deflowerer of democracy</i>.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        But the crowd appears to be in a happy mood and join a demonstrator as
        he chants through a loudhailer: &quot;If you hate the governor general,
        clap your hands,&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        This litany is suddenly interrupted when another voice in the crowd
        calls: &quot;Norman Gunston for governor general.&quot; By this time
        there are four Victoria police in uniform, what appear to be four
        plainclothes police at the main door of the royal commonwealth society
        and another six police at the front gate.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At 7.27 the crowd has grown to around 700. It becomes restive as four
        police horses are ridden into demonstrators standing out on Queens road,
        partly blocking the traffic flow. The crowd backs off very quickly. Some
        of them are old enough&nbsp; to&nbsp; remember the Springbok tour and
        the LBJ demonstrations and know how dangerous these horses can be.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately after this operation warms up the horses, police cars are
        parked at either end of the block to divert all through traffic away
        from the area.</font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Two cars attempting to drive down Queens road with dinner guests are
        forced to stop by two demonstrators lying down on the road. The guests
        are forced to walk through the demonstrators to a cacophony of boos and
        hisses. Dye and eggs are thrown.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Right on 8pm the governor general's car approaches in the rain. It is
        led by two motocycle police and is surrounded on the other three sides
        by at least 25 uniformed police, men and women. As the car meets the
        outer edge of the crowd the mounted police start riding hard in an
        attempt to force a path through the demonstrators, who now completely
        cover Queens road.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Paint, eggs, stones and an acrid smokebomb are thrown at the vice regal
        Rolls-Royce. One of the police horses shies and in backing away from the
        smoke pushes over one of the motorbikes and its rider. Fists are
        swinging. More smokebombs are thrown.</font></p>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Suddenly a young man jumps on the roof of the Rolls-Royce. Balancing
        precariously, he starts banging the windscreen with a loudhailer. The
        noise he makes is deafening. A moment later he's lifted from the car
        roof and appears to vanish in the crowd. Several others throw themselves
        on the car bonnet.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The police are slowly trying to drive a wedge through the demonstrators to the main gate but superiority of numbers and dogged
        determination are with the crowd. The shouting and chanting is
        deafening. The air is stinking and there's an undercurrent of panic as
        the horses force the demonstrators back to the footpath. Only swift
        sidestepping keeps them from under the horses flaying hooves.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Sir John and lady Kerr look shaken as their car is forced to move down
        Queens road past the royal historical society. One of the car's windows
        has been smashed during the melee and Kerr's aide, who is sitting
        alongside the chauffeur, has cuts to the face.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        As the car retreats into the dark, the crowd starts chanting again and
        calls are made for assistance in identifying two men arrested.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        A few minutes later word goes round that sir John and lady Kerr have
        been forced to enter the building from the tradesmens entrance around
        the block off Queens lane.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        During the dinner the demonstrators keep chanting: &quot;Sack Kerr . .
        .&quot; &quot;Yankee traitor . . .&quot; and &quot;Kerr, Kerr . . .
        sleazy Kerr&quot;.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        By 9pm the crowd is thinning out but there are still 54 uniformed police
        in front of the royal commonwealth society and at least another 12 who
        appear to be in plain clothes.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Before the crowd disperses it's announced that sir John invites them to
        join him again for dinner on june 21, when he will be attending a law
        society dinner at the Leonda restaurant in Wallan road, Hawthorn.</font>
