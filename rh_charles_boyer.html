              saw the opening of Melbourne's Film Festival at the National
              theatre in St Kilda. In recognition of International Womens Year
              the first film screened was the French woman director Yannick
              Bellon's <i>John's wife</i>.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; While
              the film was entertaining and well cast I went along to enjoy the best part of the show
              ...the beautiful people in the audience.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Walking
              into the foyer of the National theatre I was struck speechless by
              the sheer beauty before me. Rising above the ascending staircase
              were almost 100 multicolored balloons. Such beauty ...such good
              taste. Then I spotted Ray Fisher, the chairman of the organising
              committee, wearing the <i>biggest</i> bow tie I've ever seen. Ray
              isnt the largest man in Melbourne, and darlings I thought he was
              in v. grave danger of taking off with such a big propeller.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Natalie
              Miller, owner of Sharmill Films, and publicity director of the
              festival was looking v. Trak afro with her gollywog hairdo. Robyn
              Wallace (Robb, the fashion editor of the education department's <i>Comet</i>
              magazine) was long and lissome in same afro shakeout.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; In the auditorium I saw so many beautiful&nbsp; people. There was Geoff&nbsp;

  <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; My special mention
  must go to the Ms who made a v. regal entrance just before the lights went
  down: Kate Baillieu, just back from chasing camels around central Australia,
  looks to be getting taller. She'll soon be able to look over her seven feet
  back fence at the neighbours sunbaking in Trak. Kate was wearing the most
  amazing belt around her waist. I don't think it was the chastity type.</font></td>

        opening nights. Robin and his wife Lesley were often invited to such
