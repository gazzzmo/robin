                being made between Telecom's State Support Service, the
                supervising engineer, Metro East, and the district Telecom
                manager, Box Hill, about the reasons for the lack of a reliable
                phone service.
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; In a memo to the district
                Telecom manager, Box Hill, the commercial manager, Mr Keith
                Bell, wrote on March 4, 1984: &quot;The situation has now
                reached an intolerable position from both a customer and
                district/customer services viewpoint.<br>
                
                <img border="0" src="rh_phone_chaos_bar.jpg" width="89" height="31"><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Many customers are most dissatisfied with the
                level of service they are receiving and want action. Their
                service has been affected to the extent that they are unable to
                operate their businesses effectively.
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Several customers have
                advised of occasions where they have had to temporarily locate
                themselves outside the Blackburn exchange area in order to make
                effective calls.&quot;
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; He said that the service section of the district office was inundated by
                calls from irate subscribers and being subjected to constant abuse. He
                finished by saying that he had frequently discussed the situation
                with the internal plant manager and the acting district Telecom
                manager but they had had no success in remedying the position.
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Mr Bell also disclosed that special inspection dockets (three
                reports to service difficulties in a month) had leapt for
                Blackburn exchange. For the month ending Febrauary 22, 1984
                there were 150 for Blackburn but only 17 for Ringwood.
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                On March 6, 1984, in sending Mr Bell's memo to the
                superintending engineer construction branch, district Telecom
                manager, Mr Ron Nelson, offered his own view.
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &quot;The service being given to Blackburn exchange subscribers
                recently has been appalling and many are threatening to carry
                out an anti-Telecom campaign,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Worse than
                this, many are reporting that they are going out of business,
                because of their inability to communicate by telephone.&quot;
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                After detailing technical reasons why there were so many
                problems at the exchange, Mr Nelson made a startling
                recommendation.
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine months after
                the conversion had started he wrote: &quot;Because of the high
                level of unrest among subscribers connected to Blackburn
                exchange, I suggest we stop all work on ARE-11 conversions until
                items of common plant are provided in adequate numbers, and
                until we can ensure at all times a reasonable service will be
                provided to Blackburn subscribers.&quot;
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                After analysing all the documents released under the Freedom of
                Information Act, the Nunawading Gazette is now able to tell
                readers why they had to put up with such a rotten phone service
                for nearly a year.
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; Telecom's own
                staff make these comments among more than 50 documents
                comprising over 260 pages circulated to various departments.
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                On March 20, 1984 a Telecom staffer wrote in the work diary kept
                at the Blackburn exchange: &quot;Although he would not be quoted
                he believes that insufficient maintenance staff were in the
                exchange to monitor and fix faults that installers inevitably
                leave and which appear when installers move on to other
                areas.&quot;
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; The same day, the
                supervising engineer Metro East admitted in a memo that:
                &quot;Underlying the problem at Blackburn exchange is the
                failure of the district to bring the equipment to a proper
                condition before the ARE installation commenced. They were
                unable to do so because of a critical shortage of technical
                staff despite many representations...&quot;
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                He also said: &quot;A serious situation has developed at
                Blackburn which should have been advised to us some months
                ago...&quot;

                        &nbsp;&nbsp; Freelance journalist

                        disrupted during the conversion of Blackburn telephone
                        Exchange to computer operation, decided to investigate.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; He used the Freedom of Information Act to
                        obtain Telecom documents and memos which could reveal
                        the background to the telephone chaos which plagues
                        thousands of local household, industrial and commercial
                        telephone subscribers at the time.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; During his long battle with officialdom on
                        the issue Mr Howells won his appeal to the
                        Administrative Appeals Tribunal over certain documents
                        and papers which Telecom had refused to hand over.<br>

                free from fault
                production and in a big exchange with a large installation staff
                additional effort should be provided but was not until this
                week,&quot; he wrote. This was nearly nine months after the

                &nbsp;&nbsp; Two types of technology, analogue and digital, are
                used by Telecom to carry speech through the phone network.
                Analogue exchanges like the ARE-11 one at Blackburn carry signal
                waves which are continuously varying in shape. Around 90 per
                cent of the Melbourne suburban network is still on the older

                superintending engineer, field engineering branch.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; It
                reported: &quot;Maintenance manpower shortage may have
                contributed to the time lag in fault finding. There was a high
                level of faults found at Blackburn exchange, of which it is
                estimated 60 per cent to 70 per cent were installation
                initiated.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                They recommended additional maintenance staff should be on hand
                during ARE-11 conversion and specialised equipment, known as an
                MFC analyser, should be made available for use in fault finding.</font></p>

                Documents obtained under the FOI Act show that Telecom appeared

                district staff on December 15, 1983, district Telecom manager,
                Mr Tom Parker, admitted the conversion was not going smoothly.
                After discussing the low standard of phone service he made a
                very frank admission.
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We have had up to 450
                reports in one day on the Blackburn exchange, and an increase in
                the general complaints brought to the attention of all levels
                within the district.&quot;

                hand-written document dated December 16, 1983, headed
                &quot;Report on Blackburn exchange excessive fault rate&quot;
                contains a damning disclosure.

                &quot;The work specs are being performed on relay sets by
                technical assistants with no experience, and testing after
                putting relay sets back in service is not being carried
                out.&quot;
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; The writer also
                discloses that ARE-11 training for the officer in charge of the
                exchange would not be completed until late January and that
                staff morale was low. This was written six months after
                conversion started.
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; In the year
                it took to convert the Blackburn exchange to ARE-11 equipment
                4123 business and 12,340 private subscribers had to tolerate an
                unreliable phone service.

                Doncaster exchange is scheduled to be converted to ARE-11 in
                July, 1985, East Doncaster in May, 1986, and Templestowe in
                April/June, 1987. In February-June, 1985, Ringwood exchange is
                being converted from ARF to AXE equipment and Hawthorn from
                April-June 1985.

                faults that caused so many problems on the Blackburn exchange it
                is to be hoped that Telecom have learnt a number of valuable
                lessons from the Blackburn bungling. It was made at considerable
                cost and inconvenience to their customers.</font></td>

        Note: When the Blackburn phone exchange upgrade
        was carried out, local people were complaining loud and long about the
        problems they were experiencing with their phone service. It appeared
        obvious to me that Telecom Australia was not telling everything they
        knew about the extent of the problems their customers were reporting.
        <p align="justify">When I attempted to use the Freedom of Information (FoI) laws to
        unearth the truth about this fiasco, Telecom fought me bitterly to avoid
        releasing many of the documents. The Australian Journalists’
        Association backed me in my fight with Telecom for all the documents I
        was seeking.</p>
        <p align="justify">After getting access to the documents I sought, I made a detailed
        submission to a Senate Select Committee which was set up to inquiry into
        the workings of the <b><i>Freedom of Information Act</i></b>. I was
        highly critical of Telecom for the manner in which they attempted to
        deny documents to me as I was seeking them as a journalist &quot;acting
        in the public interest&quot;. Following my submission, I was invited to
        appear before the committee at a public hearing in Melbourne.</p>
        <p align="justify">I wrote a similar article, based on the same FoI documents, for <b><i>CHOICE</i></b>,
        the monthly magazine of the Australian Consumers’ Association. It
        appeared in the February 1986 issue on pages 34 and 35 under the heading
        &quot;Telecom bungles upgrading project&quot;.</font>
