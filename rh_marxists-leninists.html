                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ONE
                OF Australia's most progressive churches, the Unitarian Peace
                Memorial church in East Melbourne, has seen its congregation
                split by internal disputes over the way in which the church
                should be run.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Two ministers, Stanley Moore and Terrence Stokes, have left in
                the past four years, and the minister for 22 years before them,
                Victor James, has severed all connection with the church.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                (James was a leading figure in the peace and anti-Vietnam
                movements in the past two decades. Among his most celebrated
                deeds was his defiance of Menzies by travelling to China using
                his British passport when Australians were not supposed to visit
                China and chairman Mao.)</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The management committee has now decided not to appoint a
                minister to the church.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The catalyst for the split was the takeover by a group led by
                Len Cooper, an organiser with the Postal Teletechnicians union,
                of the majority of positions for the management committee of the
                church.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Since Cooper became acting chairman of the management committee,
                two regular attenders at the church have been Vic and Vida
                Little. Both were members of the original Communist party and
                went with Ted Hill into the Communist party (marxist-leninist).
                Vida Little worked as an organiser for Hill and when she and her
                husband left Hill's party she was denounced in <i>Vanguard</i>,
                january 30, 1975.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <i>Vanguard</i> stated: &quot;We have quite definite
                ideological, political and organisational differences with Mrs
                Little . . . For example, we disagree with Mrs Little's
                acceptance of orthodox municipal activity, trade union politics
                and more lately her activities in the Unitarian church.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Cooper has used his special skills to get control for his
                supporters in the Unitarian church. His sister Ms Marion Harper
                now has a paid part time position with the church. A committee
                meeting approved Harper as a member of the church and appointed
                her office secretary
                at the same meeting.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Cooper's mother and stepfather both joined the church early this
                year. It is reported that at a meeting a couple of months ago 16
                new members were admitted. Most of these are stated to be in
                sympathy with Cooper's politics.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Late last year Len Cooper issued a document of 30 pages, plus 11
                pages of appendices, which was circulated to members of the
                Unitarian Peace Memorial church. Marked &quot;Restricted&quot;,
                it was entitled <i>Unitarian church at the crossroads</i>. It
                started by saying: &quot;The Unitarian church is going through
                very troubled times. If the current problems are not solved the
                church will diminish further and ultimately die.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The document then purports to analyse the ministries of the last
                two ministers, Stanley Moore and Terrence Stokes. Because of the
                nature of the unsubstantiated allegations made, <i>Nation review</i>
                is unable to quote any more of the document.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The central point of the allegations was that both Stanley Moore
                and Terrence Stokes were members of the Liberal party. Moore
                admitted on november 29, 1972, in the <i>Herald</i>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

                a member of the McKinnon branch of the Liberal party and Stokes
                was a member of the Ivanhoe branch of the same party until he
                resigned in 1971. From 1972 Stokes has been a member of the ALP.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Almost a quarter of the official voting membership of the congregation of 84 have resigned from the church
                since a special meeting of the congregation was held on february
                25. This was attended
                by Victor James and Terrence Stokes.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; At the meeting Len Cooper handed over the chairmanship to Alan
                Ratcliffe so that Cooper could read from another document,
                attacking Stokes and his ministry, for three quarters of an
                hour. When James attempted to move that the speaker be no longer
                heard, Ratcliffe would not accept the motion. James left the
                meeting at that point and was followed by about 20 other
                members.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                James has now resigned as minister emeritus and has advised that
                he has now completely severed his connections with the Melbourne
                Unitarian church. It is believed that an announcement will soon
                be made of the formation of a group of unitarians banded behind
                James. One of the rules of the new group is expected to provide
                for the political independence of all members.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Since unitarians are not required to&nbsp; make any profession of any
                particular doctrine and no creed has been adopted by the church,
                the fact that some members have attacked others for their
                political attitudes is hard to follow. Unitarians believe in the
                innate goodness of man and take a humanist stance. Unitarianism
                is ofter referred to as the religion of reason. Yet one member
                of the marxist-leninist group has stated that those who didnt
                agree with their political attitudes were their enemies.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Since the marxist-leninist group grabbed control, speakers at
                the church have included George Crawford, Joan Coxsedge, John
                Halfpenny, Len Cooper, Peter Abrehart and Vic Little. It is said
                that the M-L group are enrolling new members so that control
                stays in their hands.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Assets of the church include investments in giltedged securities
                of over $100,000 plus the property at East Melbourne, which is
                conservatively estimated at $250,000.</font>
