                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">VICTORIA'S Liberal
                government headed by Rupert Hamer is locked in a battle with a
                private firm over who should develop a one acre block of land in
                Melbourne's golden mile.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                land, estimated to be worth at least $6.5 million, is owned by
                Zeus Nominees Pty Ltd. It is adjacent to the Museum station site
                for Melbourne's underground and is in the block bounded by
                Swanston, Latrobe, Elizabeth and Lonsdale streets. The site is
                mainly occupied by old, rundown buildings.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Following a request from the Melbourne Underground Rail Loop
                Authority (MURLA), and the Melbourne city council, George J.
                Connor &amp; Associates produced a report on the development
                potential of the block.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                report, presented in august last year, said: &quot;There is no
                central city block in Melbourne or in any other major Australian
                city that has greater scope and need for planned redevelopment
                over the next 5-10 years.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; It
                has been estimated that the Museum station will bring 50,000
                people a day into the area. The report predicted that the block
                would generate redevelopment of more than $200 million.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Zeus
                Nominees Pty Ltd started to acquire properties in the block in
                1972. They managed to consolidate 23 properties in a site of
                just over one acre. But since then Zeus has been unable to get
                permission to develop the land.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Zeus
                wrote to transport minister Ray Meagher and local government
                minister Alan Hunt. The state government declared the area an
                investigation area on february 22, 1974. Hunt commissioned the
                Town and Country Planning Board to report in 12 months time.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                Town and Country Planning Board sat on the job for four months
                without doing anything, until complaints by landholders in the
                block became so intense that the government set up a steering
                committee in late july with representation from MURLA, the MCC,
                the Town and Country Planning Board and the board of works.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                committee's finished report went first to Hunt, then to a
                cabinet subcommittee comprising Hunt, Meagher, and
                attorney-general Vernon Wilcox.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                report, which was released last wednesday, recommends that the
                whole of the investigation area needs controlled development and
                that it be declared a designated area pursuant to the
                Development Areas act. This effectively freezes all land
                development and speculation in the area for two years.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; In
                the meantime Zeus have advertised their land for auction on
                april 23. They have advertised worldwide.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; When
                the Connor report was presented last august it was estimated
                that the Zeus site was worth $4.2 million. Today it is estimated
                to be worth $6.5 million. If the government decides to purchase
                or compulsorily acquire the Zeus owned land, where will they get
                the money from?</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                state of Victoria is now committed to a loop system for an
                underground which, Victorian cabinet members have confided to
                close friends, is going to cost in excess of $600 million. The
                original announcement of the cost of the underground in 1970 was
                $80 million. The cost is to be shared three ways with the state
                government paying 50 percent, the Melbourne city council and the
                board of works contributing 25 percent each.</font></p>

                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Verdana" size="2">The
                federal Labor government looks upon the Melbourne underground as
                being a massive misallocation of resources and has shown no
                interest in financing such a fiasco. It is totally opposed to
                the idea of providing finance for an underground which will
                improve the value of properties held by developers.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                Melbourne loop project was entered into without any cost benefit
                analysis taking place. This was despite the visit of transport
                minister Meagher to Canada in 1967 to study the Toronto loop
                system.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Toronto built its loop for nothing. The city did this by
                purchasing all the available land around the loop and then
                selling all the land back at increased prices because of the new
                business brought into the area by the loop. When it sold the
                land back to redevelopers it made huge profits.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                Melbourne city council has said that it can't meet its loop
                payments for this year. If the MCC increases its rates
                substantially to pay the increasing amounts due on its share,
                the council will drive firms out of Melbourne into the lower
                rated surrounding areas.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord
                mayor Ron Walker points out that it is the people who are going
                to use the loop least who are going to have to pay for it. He
                says that loop is an integral part of the railways metropolitan
                transport system and that an undue share of the cost is being
                put on city dwellers and land owners.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Rupert Hamer has to bear a lot of the criticism for the problems
                now associated with the loop. When he was minister for local
                government, Hamer was involved in a lot of the initial
                decision-making over the loop. It was Hamer who promised father
                Negry of the nearby St Francis church that under no
                circumstances would the church area be placed under
                investigation. However, subsequently it was.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
                three major land developers in the designated area are Zeus
                Nominees Pty Ltd, the Australian Development Corporation Ltd and
                Downtown Car parks Pty Ltd.</font></p>

        Note: When the Melbourne underground rail loop was
        being planned, serious questions started to be asked by some people
        about who the main beneficiaries of this development might be. With the
        help of some highly placed insiders, and a number of company searches, I
        did this piece of investigative journalism. When the article appeared it
