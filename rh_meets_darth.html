      <td><font face="Times New Roman" size="6"><i>Darth Carla meets Robin...</i></font>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A long time ago (around
        1985) in a galaxy far, far away, Darth Carla (the good and beautiful)
        received word that her dastardly evil twin brother Vader had sought
        refuge on an small insignificant blue green planet somewhere out on the
        western arm of the milky way, where he was posing as some guy called
        George Lucas and making some really fairly good movies.&nbsp; <i>Hmmmmm....</i></font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaping into her luxury
        space capsule (without spilling a single drop of her goblet of chilled
        French champagne), she sped off after him, determined to bring him to
        Truth, Justice, and the Darth Carla way...</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Arriving at the small
        insignificant blue green planet, quaintly called &quot;Earth&quot;, she
        landed in a somewhat messy backyard in the outer suburbs of Melbourne
        (Australia.&nbsp; Her geography wasn't too good)&nbsp; Flipping the
        switch on the luxury space capsule's cloaking device, she exited the
        vehicle just as...</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Winter (AKA Carla)
        walked out of her back door into the same outer suburban back
        yard.&nbsp; The two stared at each other in astonishment.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Who are <i>you</i>?&quot;
        they said almost in unison, whereupon they both laughed, and became best
        friends.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it wasn't <i>quite</i>
        like that, but close enough.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Winter (AKA Carla) had
        just discovered Bulletin Boards (BBSs) and had taken to them like a duck
        to water, so much so in fact, that she had the dubious fame of being the
        only woman (in Victoria, anyway) to use Bulletin Boards on a regular
        basis. Like maybe three, or four or five times a day (you should have
        seen her phone bill!) I suppose it was inevitable that she and Robin
        should catch up with each other somewhere along the (modem) lines.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever. Robin (in his
        capacity as an inquisitive journalist) became aware of this odd person
        and attempted to get in touch with her.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; In those days Winter
        was known as &quot;The REAL ARTICLE&quot; because everyone on <i>those</i>&nbsp;
        sorts of BBSs (read: hacker boards) used pseudonyms, and because she'd
        once written a &quot;real&quot; article on modems and BBSs that had
        actually been <i>published</i>!&nbsp; Yeah, anyway, Robin sent her a
        message with the subject line &quot;<i>Desperately seeking Real</i>&quot;
        (or words to that effect), saying that he was a journalist who would
        like to do a story on her, etc., etc.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm afraid to say that
        Winter didn't believe a word of it!&nbsp; She honestly thought he was
        some little kid trying to pull her leg - Journalist indeed!&nbsp; What
        sort of journalist who wanted to get in touch with you would use a P.O.
        Box contact address, anyway?!&nbsp; She ignored the message.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Time passed.. Darth
        Carla, Winter's alter ego, was born from a computer game she and some
        friends were playing. She continued to make a pest of herself on as many
        Bulletin Boards as she could possibly log onto by leaving terribly long
        and convoluted messages (like this essay) on all of them. One Sysop
        (Vegemite sandwich, anyone?) in sheer self defence told her she should
        start her own Bulletin Board.&nbsp; She did.&nbsp; It was called
        &quot;The REAL CONNECTION (the REAL world starts here!)&quot; and it was
        very popular.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Again Robin attempted
        to interest her in having an article written about her exploits.&nbsp;
        No dice.&nbsp; Laughingly she told some young friends who happened to be
        visiting her BBS about this weird person who claimed to be a
        journalist.&nbsp; They looked at each other. &quot;Robin?&quot; said one
        &quot;Oh we know him!&nbsp; He is a journalist! He goes to the same
        computer club that we go to!&quot;</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Shame! Mortification!
        Red faced... So at long last Winter got in touch with Robin, who did try
        to do an article on her and her Bulletin Board, but it was too late...
        the magazine closed just before the article was to go to print, so I
        guess you all miss out on the Grand Story.&nbsp; Sorry. Mea culpa.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, Winter,
        her young boyfriend Julian (AKA Deep Image), and Robin and his family
        became close friends, and have been ever since. Winter ended up marrying
        her young boyfriend (twenty years her junior) and this year will mark
        their twelfth wedding anniversary. With the advent of the Internet and
        the WWW, Bulletin Boards lost popularity and so after eleven years, The
        REAL CONNECTION (later known as &quot;death... by chocolate&quot;)
        closed down. We had a wake. Now Julian is a computer systems engineer
        and unix guru and Winter is a web designer and web graphics nut at
        Digital Tapestries (see below) who happens to enjoy the boredom of
        transcription and keyboarding, and Robin decided to go public and set up
        a web site of his own....</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Which is how yours
        truly got to be doing the web authoring for Robin's site!</i></font></td>
