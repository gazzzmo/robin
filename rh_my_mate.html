                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
                I called in to Mick's shoe repair shop in Rathdowne Street,
                North Carlton, last week with a pair of shoes to be soled and
                heeled, I wasn't prepared for the shock news. After 50 years in
                Rathdowne Street repairing shoes, Mick Tallon has to close on 24
                December. The property has been sold.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The two-income trendies and property
                developers who are quickly taking over the Carlton I grew up in
                probably won't know or miss Mick and his son Frank, who works
                with him.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Mick's shop at 641 Rathdowne Street is a
                solid two-storey 19th century brick building,
                probably built during the land boom. The corrugated iron
                verandah, which is in need of repair, is supported by those
                solid old iron pillars that the sacked city councillors
                detested. The window needs a clean but it still allows Mick and
                Frank to wave to friends as they walk past.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you step inside you're welcomed by the
                smell of leathers, rubber and glue. Shelves and benches are all
                cluttered and piled high with shoes and boots in various stages
                of repair. A faded sign on one wall advises that people over 80
                accompanied by their parents will be given credit. On another
                wall is a 1977 calendar embossed on a large rectangle of
                leather.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; If you happen to arrive near lunch time
                you'll be tempted by the aroma of minestrone, beans or some
                other simple dish that Mick is warming for a quick meal. People
                call in during the day just for a chat. You're not just a number
                on a docket when you get your shoes repaired at 641, in fact
                Mick doesn't believe in dockets. He writes your name in a thick
                pencil on a convenient part of the shoe. Fool proof and
                personalised.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Mick Tallon was born in Italy in 1906 and started to learn
                the craft from a village boot maker when he was five years old. His mother had to pay the boot maker to teach
                him.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;It wasn't very long when he told my
                mother: 'Look, you don't have to pay me any more. I'll give
                something to the boy.' I&nbsp;was terrible happy,&quot; Mick said.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He migrated to Australia in 1923.
                Following a
                stint managing a farm at Shoreham Mick got sick of the country
                and came to live in Melbourne during the Depression. A cousin
                who was a shoe repairer in Gertrude Street, Fitzroy, encouraged
                Mick to make a start in shoe repairing in Carlton and he soon
                found a shop in Rathdowne Street.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Mick's area is a retail retreat now with a
                newsagent, a record shop, the Valrosa Cellars licensed grocer
                and a great French butcher called La Vache Qui Rit (The Laughing
                Cow) within the block. He remembers how, before World War II, it
                was a thriving shopping centre with three fruit shops, three
                butchers, two delicatessens, two lolly shops and a jeweller.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;As time went on the Australian people
                moved out of here, the migrants came with different eating
                customs and the number of shops declined.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Taylor's the
                delicatessen (we used to
                call them ham and beef shops then) used to employ five to seven
                people in the busy period. As the migrants came in all those
                places died out and businesses and offices took their
                place.&quot;</font></p>
              </td>
  <center>
                <td valign="top" align="left" width="20">
                <img border="0" src="transbrd.gif" width="20" height="10"></td>
  </center>
                <td valign="top" align="left" width="345">
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Mick is still hoping that a similar fate does
                not await him.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; As he begins to talk about shoe fashions and
                quality, Mick's eyes light up and he starts to reminisce.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When I started here you could buy a good pair of men's
                shoes for 7/6 or 75 cents a pair. A very good quality pair of
                Marshall or Wallace shoes were 21/- or $2.10 a pair. They were
                first class box calf or kid.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He remembers Charlie Ward, who conducted
                community singing in Carlton in the 1930s, complaining about
                some shoddy shoes at the time. &quot;If Charlie Ward was to
                come in today and see the rubbish shoes which come into
                Australia I think his hair would stand on end.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The army of customers who travel in from
                places like Caulfield, Oakleigh, Nunawading, Ringwood,
                Kinglake and Wycheproof are in for a shock if they see the
                notice in his window about his imminent closure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Mick doesn't want to move away from his
                beloved Carlton because, as he says, his customers don't have
                to come to see him too often.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &quot;I do use good materials, so that it
                will last a long time,&quot; he said. &quot;Because I have
                such a lot of customers I want my repairs to last as long as
                possible so that they don't have to come too often. Not
                because I don't want to see them - but I want them to get a
                good wear for their money.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He used to be next door, at 643 Rathdowne
                Street, for 41 years and moved into 641 on a two-year lease
                with yearly renewals. That's when things started to go wrong.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;
                About two months ago the owner of his
                premises came and said he had to raise the rent because he had
                to borrow money on the property at a higher interest rate.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I was happy enough,&quot; Mick said.
                &quot;But he didn't say a word that he had the property on the
                market to sell. It came as a bombshell when he came and said a
                young fellow had bought the premises.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I said to him that I wished I had
                known before, because there was an empty shop only two doors
                away that I could have got into. It had been empty a long
                time.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He is still looking for a suitable shop
                around Rathdowne Street, North Carlton.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Unless I can find something around
                here, I'll be stuck,&quot; he told me. &quot;I'll have to take
                all my leather, tools and machinery home until I can get something somewhere.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as I was about to leave, with my
                skilfully repaired shoes that Mick has kept in good condition
                for more than seven years, I asked him what his son, Frank,
                who is in his mid forties, will do if they have to shut up
                shop completely on Christmas Eve.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Frank will have to go on the
                Government payroll,&quot; he said with a kindly twinkle in his
                eye. &quot;Because he can't do anything else.&quot;</font></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
