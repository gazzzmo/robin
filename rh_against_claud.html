              <td valign="top" align="left" width="345">
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">CLAUD WOODS is
                a name that's hard to forget. In the early 1970s Claud was
                actively associating with the National Socialist party of
                Australia, a minuscule group more commonly called nazis.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Imagine my concern to see that late last month the Melbourne <i>Herald</i>
                reported that Claud Woods, the treasurer of People Against
                Communism, and Alain Birtley, PAC vice president, were chased
                and beaten by a group of demonstrators.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Woods was fortunate enough to escape from the mob with bruises
                but Birtley had to be hospitalised with a punctured lung, broken
                ribs and bruises. Police have arrested a man and charged him
                with assault and assault with a weapon.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                After the attack the president of People Against Communism,
                Jennifer McCallum, said that she was more determined than ever
                to get maoists and trotskyites outlawed. She also said the PAC
                was trying to raise enough money to cover Birtley's hospital and
                medical costs.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                This week I phoned Ms McCallum to ask if she was aware that
                Claud Woods had been a member of the National Socialist party of
                Australia and had been the executive officer of the central
                executive.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                With her frank forthrightness Ms McCallum said: &quot;He's no
                more a nazi than I am. He's the most hardworking member we've
                got.&quot;</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Because the police had said that some of the demonstrators
                outside the Hilton were wearing nazi swastika armbands, I asked
                if she knew if Woods and any of his PAC companions were adorned
                in this way. &quot;Good God no. The police can vouch for
                that,&quot; she replied.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                She did say that Claud has a very quick temper but she was also
                quick to point out that she thought he was no more a fascist
                than she was. Ms McCallum also said that PAC's legal adviser,
                sir Reginald Sholl had said that if anything is printed about
                Woods by any paper they'll be sued.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Referring to Woods' activities with the NSPA during the Viet Nam
                moratorium marches she said: &quot;I admire Claud Woods for the
                stand he took during the moratoriums.&quot; But her <i>piece de
                resistance</i> came when she disclosed that Woods is a member of
                a lodge and a mason.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                When he was asked if he had told PAC of his previous association
                with a leading NSPA person and his involvement as the executive
                officer of the NSPA central executive, Woods denied that he was
                ever a member or a card holder of the NSPA.</font></td>
              <td valign="top" align="left" width="20"><img border="0" src="transbrd.gif" width="20" height="10"></td>
              <td valign="top" align="left" width="345">
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Verdana" size="2">Although
                I referred him to the mention he gets in a letter NSPA member
                Katrina Young wrote to fellow member Dr E. R. Cawthron (reported
                in David Harcourt's book <i>Everyone wants to be fuehrer</i>)
                Woods continued to deny membership of NSPA.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; In
                a further effort to jog Woods' memory I reminded him of the
                Melbourne <i>Herald</i> report of the attempt by eight nazi
                party members to distribute pamphlets in the Melbourne city
                square during the may day celebrations.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The <i>Herald</i> said: &quot;Claud Woods of the nazi party was
                hit in the face by a man in the city square today. Mr Woods lost
                a tooth and got a cut lip. Several people bustled two of the
                members in party uniform and police intervened. A group of
                students tried to burn a swastika armband but police took it
                from them. Soon afterwards police had to manhandle several
                people away from the nazis as tempers flared.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Woods said that although he may have been standing near the
                nazis in the city square that day it didnt make him a member. He
                was willing to admit that he had some association with 
                leading australian nazi Cass Young and added as an aside:
                &quot;The guy was also jewish, by the way.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; At
                that stage it seemed rather pointless to ask Woods if he
                remembered being photographed as he was being attacked by a
                Footscray shopkeeper in 1971 when a group of national socialists
                held a demonstration against communism. Or if he recalled being
                photographed leading members of the NSPA in a demonstration in
                Brisbane in 1969 against the Red and Black bookshop. Claud's
                sign said <i>Free gasoline and matches for NLF</i> and the one
                being carried behind him said <i>Communism is jewish</i>.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; On
                wednesday night Ms McCallum announced that PAC has expelled
                Woods. She also said the executive had been &quot;misled in
                relation to this matter&quot; but refused to say how.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Woods was phoned by Ms McCallum on tuesday night (after I had
                queried her about her knowledge of his earlier involvement with
                the nazis) and asked for his resignation. On wednesday it was
                decided to expel him.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                She disclosed that the decision to expel Woods had been made
                after she talked to one of the PAC patrons and its legal adviser
                sir Reginald Sholl.</font></td>

        Note 1: People Against Communism was one of a number
        of strange groups which appeared in Australia in the 1970s. When my
        attention was drawn to the fact that Claud Woods was a member, I started
        to wonder if PAC were aware of his interesting background and history of
        political activism. After asking the questions I did of PAC and Woods, I
        was advised by friends to be more aware of my personal security.
        <p>Years later I discovered that Claud has been employed for many years
        in a highly influential, and often feared, federal government
        department!
        <p>Author's Note 2: In many documents pertaining to his activities, Claud's name has been
        misspelt as &quot;Claude Woods&quot;. Unconfirmed reports claim this
        even happened in certain government agency files!
