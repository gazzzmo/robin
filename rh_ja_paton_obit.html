              <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Jack Archibald (John)
              Paton</b></font>
              <p align="justify">

              <font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Former deputy display
              advertising manager and first marketing manager of The Age;
              leading advertising agency executive. Born: 4 June 1920. Died: 18
              August 1995, aged 75.</i></font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; John
              Paton spent his business life in the creative world of advertising
              and marketing.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Paton
              joined <i>The Age</i> in 1967 as deputy advertising manager (display) after a highly
              successful post-war career including senior executive positions with a
              number of leading advertising agencies such as J. Walter Thompson
              and Paton Advertising.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; To many
              in the newspaper scene it seemed a strange appointment. What they did not realise was that Ranald
              Macdonald, Graham Perkin, Bill Bland, John Nash and a few other
              senior executives at <i>The Age</i> were planning a frontal
              assault on the dominance of the <i>Herald &amp; Weekly Times</i> in
              Melbourne. The first strike was to be a new Sunday newspaper, <i>Newsday</i>,
              and&nbsp; Paton was to be the first advertising manager.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He
              played a leading role in the revitalisation of <i>The Age&nbsp;</i>
              under Perkin<br>
 and Macdonald in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&nbsp;</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              &quot;John established a very good rapport with the editorial
              staff via the editor. Graham Perkin respected John for his
              marketing skills and they worked wonderfully together improving
              the paper's editorial appeal,&quot; said Mr Bill Bland, the
              general manager at the time.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
              &quot;Ranald and I thought <i>The Age</i> needed a top person with
              widely recognised marketing and advertising experience and John was the ideal man for the job.&quot;</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Paton
              was also an important member of the senior management group, which was planning a number of projects including
              'Project X', the codename for the launch of <i>Newsday</i>.&nbsp;</font></p>

            <td valign="top" align="left" width="345">
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; When
              the Victorian Printers Operative Union&nbsp; and&nbsp; the
              newsagents' association stonewalled the introduction&nbsp; of</font>
              <font face="Verdana" size="2">Sunday newspapers, <i>Newsday</i>
              was instead launched as an evening daily in September 1969. This
              was originally stage two of Project X and was brought forward
              after the firm had employed so many extra staff to work on the
              thwarted Sunday paper.</font>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Paton
              was part of the inner management group planning a series of
              developments to make profits from the increased press capacity
              when <i>The Age</i> moved from its cramped Collins Street location
              into Spencer Street in 1969.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Whenever we had a marketing or an advertising problem, John was never short of a creative answer,&quot; Mr Bland
              said.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
              of Paton's innovations was to have Irving Saulwick carry out
              readership research of <i>The Age</i>, which introduced the
              concept of &quot;profile&quot; selling of newspaper advertising in
              Australia. This research was also the first to make large-scale
              use of computer analysis of readership survey figures.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Until
              then, sales staff sold on total circulation figures, but Paton had
              the sales staff talking and selling the profile of <i>The Age</i>
              reader as being in the upper income group, professionals with senior executive positions, with higher standards of
              education and &quot;decision makers&quot;.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Our aim was to position <i>The Age</i> as the leading paper
              for national advertising in Australia. John's marketing skills and
              his knowledge of media buying in advertising agencies saw us
              achieve that and dramatically increase our share of the
              market,&quot; Mr Bland said.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; When <i>Newsday</i>
              folded in May 1970, Paton was retained as the first marketing
              manager of <i>The Age</i>. He stayed in that role until his
              retirement in 1984. After that, he was a marketing consultant for another three years.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Paton
              started his life-long career in advertising and radio broadcasting
              before World War II. He served with HQ First Australian Corps
              South-West Pacific Area during the war. He was a hard-working
              member of Legacy for more than 37 years.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He is
              survived by his wife, Jean, a daughter, Gillian, and a son,
              Russell.</font></p>
