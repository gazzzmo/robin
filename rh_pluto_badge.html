        GALLERY</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
        WHAT A WUNDERBAR night at the opening of the Realities gallery in Toorak
        last week. That wonderfully unaffected Marianne Baillieu invited me to
        the launching of Roger Kemp's latest work.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Thrilled when I arrived outside Realities to note that one of the poor
        people of Toorak had parked their Rolls-Royce smackbang in front of the
        main door. It gave me a warm feeling to see Marianne's sister-in-law
        Kate &quot;AM&quot; Baillieu arriving in a terribly trendy Renault 12
        with two male companions - one of whom appeared to be about ten. Kate
        looked the utter mother as she adjusted junior's socks.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Inside the gallery Roger Kemp's works were <i>stunning</i>. Marianne B
        looked the true scandinavian beauty that she is in her lilac gown with
        the scooped neckline. Though it was rather coarse of one of her guests
        to say, <i>sotto voce</i>, that she has the deepest cleavage west of
        Orrong road, Toorak.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Magnificently masculine Matcham Skipper was one of the most comfortably
        dressed&nbsp; men present with his moss green suede jacket, black
        trousers, Eltham mudcaked boots and pendant. That man looks so strong .
        . . Advertising tycoon Peter Clemenger in his grey (not flannel) suit
        and blue tie made the perfect contrast to Matcham.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Samantha's show stopper award has to go to the delicate young male
        wearing blue jeans topped with a lime green jacket with a <i>tres chic</i>
        Granny Davis bread emblem on the top pocket. A Pluto badge pinned to the
        jacket highlighted this magnificent ensemble. His hair was done Sassoon
        style.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Caroline Parker looked her usual radiant self. Melbourne's lord mayor
        Ronnie Walker looked apprehensively around the gallery just to make
        certain sir John Kerr wasnt in attendance. Ronnie's wife Barbara was
        wearing a thoroughly practical and understated little black dress. She
        didnt look at all like one of those discreet shop assistants at Georges.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        When Marianne Baillieu asked the 300 mainly rich invited guests to be
        quiet for a few minutes after she said a delightfully short few words to
        open the gallery, they showed what perfect pigs many Toorak types can
        be. Most of them stayed quiet for less than one minute and then it was
        absolutely impossible to hear the fine music the quartet were playing.
        Such extraordinary bad manners from people who should know better.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        One of the few people trying to listen to the quartet was a beautiful
        lass with an interesting Maria Schneider face and a <i>Last tango in
        Paris</i> hairstyle to match. Her ethnic-look Bails brown sweater
        contrasted with her pink and white skirt and her high black boots. The
        light brown beads added just the right accent. She had a v generous
        mouth.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Trendy graffiti photographer Rennie &quot;Fuck&quot; Ellis was managing
        to look suitably stoned when you could get a&nbsp; </font></td>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">glimpse
        of his expression behind his funny, droopy Fu Manchu moustache. Rennie
        was clad in the trendies uniform of blue jeans which were topped by a
        scruffy looking green jacket. Rennie's wife Caroline was wearing a
        pained expression.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        My dear old friend Claudia &quot;The toughest man in the radio&quot;
        Wright was surrounded by her court jesters and attendants right in the
        middle of the main gallery. Georges Mora was wearing a v amazing brown,
        geometric butterfly bowtie. Lorraine Dickens, the director of opposition
        gallery Bartonis, was really resplendent in an orange jumpsuit that did
        amazing things for her complexion. Lorraine's solicitor husband Michael
        wore a conservative two piece suit.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Experienced photographer of nude Nedlands ballet dancers, Paul Cox, was
        giving a convincing impersonation of Antonioni with a movie camera and
        harsh, intrusive floodlamps. PC was accompanied by a lovely young thing
        wearing a caramel suede frock laced lovingly at the bodice and with the
        most unusual snakeskin trim. Not sure what type of snake it was, but I
        dont think it was a trouser snake.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Saw David Bardas, the head of the Sportsgirl group, in a plain blue suit
        which didnt seem to belong to the funfashion image he's built so well
        for Sportsgirl. David looks as if he has lost weight.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Also seen were playwright David Williamson, Laurence Beck, cow killing
        artist Ivan Durrant, mountaineer Michael Morris and film critic Andrew
        McKay.</font></p>
