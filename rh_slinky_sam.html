              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ISNT it v terrible the way people
              snub you because you're honest? After I wrote about boring old <i>Borsalino
              and co</i> a few weeks ago I havent exactly been swept off my feet
              with invites to previews and premieres. I gather some people didnt
              like my frankness. Although Philip Nelson, that nice radio
              personality from the ABC, wrote me a super note in which he
              expressed a keen desire to meet me <i>tete-a-tete</i>.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is all a v
              roundabout way of saying I didnt get an invite to the premiere of <i>The
              great Macarthy</i> last week at Melbourne's marvellous old
              Athenaeum theatre in Collins street. I'm sure those young
              whippersnappers who read trendy <i> Nation review</i> wouldnt remember
              when the Athenaeum had its very own orchestra which used to play
              before each performance, also at interval.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Memories of those fine old players came flooding back as I waltzed up Collins street
              to observe the antics of the bourgeoisie attending the premiere of
              <i>The great Macarthy</i>. For there, cluttering up the footpath
              admirably, and adding to the hilarious confusion, were 17 splendid
              male members (pardon the expression) of the South Melbourne City
              Band.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Must I say I was a
              mite miffed to see that the red carpet which had been run out from
              the theatre for the beautiful people to walk on was about a foot
              short of reaching the kerb.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing listening
              to the band I thought it was simply splendid the way a member of
              the working class had parked his battered green Ford Zephyr
              utility smackbang in front of the theatre.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Noticing a
              ubiquitous Yellow cab pulling up near the moth-eaten red carpet I held my breath until the occupants appeared.
              Bliss. Another star for my social constellation. It was none other
              than John Jarratt, who plays the great Macarthy. He had a very
              sweet young person with him. Didnt notice what she was wearing
              because I was all eyes for John who had very smartly flared black
              slacks, an <i>almost</i> seethrough white shirt with the most
              exquisite carmine colored embroidery. He also appeared to be
              wearing an interesting eye shadow and eye liner. Or maybe the job
              of driving cabs in Sydney between films is giving him
              &quot;character&quot; lines so young. Poor darling!</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Next I became aware
              of a very handsome young couple striding down the Collins street
              hill. It was none other than the Labor member for Casey, Charles
              Race Thorson Mathews, and his lovely wife Iola. Race, as he
              prefers to be called (<i>no wonder</i>), was wearing a very serviceable
              blue suit. However, I think Iola should suggest to him
              that if he believes, as others do, that he's future PM material he
              shouldnt wear a brown overcoat with it.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; That wellknown
              director for ABC television, Christopher Muir, was the next
              multimedia personality that I spotted. Melbourne readers probably
              remember Christopher's association with St Martin's theatre about
              two years ago. Christopher was wearing a v dramatic black alpaca
              coat. This contrasted magnificently with his gold rimmed glasses
              and his close cropped blond hair.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Bruce Spence, of <i>Stork</i>
              fame, arrived looking as though he hadnt had time to change from a
              Pram Factory production which investigated the dialectic position
              of garbage men in society.</font></p>
            </td>
              <td valign="top" align="left" width="20"><img border="0" src="transbrd.gif" width="20" height="10"></td>
              <td valign="top" align="left" width="345">
              <p align="justify">
              <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Jack
              Clancy, who is <i>Nation review's</i> answer to the loved film
              critic of the <i>Age</i>, Colin Bennett, arrived looking as if
              he had slept the whole day at Latrobe university in the clothes
              he was wearing and really looked better up on the screen in the
              scene in the classroom where he appears as one of Judy Morris's
              students. He was closely followed by a person called Graeme
              Blundell who my nonU friends tell me is a person who portrays a
              sex-crazed Australian male with the unlikely name of &quot;Alvin
              Purple&quot;. Little Graeme was accompanied by his wife Kerry
              Dwyer.</font>
              </p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I saw the
              most amazing sight of the evening. Gosh, I couldnt believe my
              eyes. A tall, willowy woman wearing a full length multicolored
              floral gown entered the theatre. But it was what was around her
              neck that absolutely amazed me. To the casual observer it may
              have looked like a feather boa but to my suspicious eye it
              looked unbelievably like shredded Kotex. How daring can one get?</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; My mind was
              distracted by hearing one of the guests refer to the champagne
              supper after the show which was to be held at the Athenaeum
              gallery. After deciding to gently gatecrash it, I tottered off
              to the Australia hotel to have a quiet drink with a few of my
              dear male friends at the basement woolshed bar. . . v gay.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Arriving back at the theatre around 11 pm I was able to mingle
              with the beautiful people and I actually shared a lift with that
              well known multimedia personality Vi Greenandahalf who appears
              on GTV9 with <i>Vi's pad</i> and also writes for the radical <i>Sunday
              observer</i>. Vi looked <i>wunderbar</i> in a bountiful black
              tent dress trimmed with a v fetching red flower. For one
              fleeting moment I thought Wirth's circus was back in town.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              As he got into the lift a rather nice young man said: &quot;How
              many does this lift hold?&quot; Before anyone else could reply,
              virago Vi said: &quot;You'd better count me as two.&quot; Isnt
              she absolutely marvellous? What a delicious sense of humor.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Then I was up at the gallery and fortunately no one was checking
              invitations. The gallery looks rather like those dreary country
              mechanics institutes that were the venue for the bachelors and
              spinsters dances of my dear departed youth.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              One of the stars of <i>The great Macarthy</i>, Judy Morris was
              absolutely surrounded by a stand of very butch men who were
              redolent of eucalyptus oil, goanna ointment and sweaty
              jockstraps. Heavenly.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              I wasnt able to look Judy in the face after remembering what
              that terribly rude person John Hepworth wrote about her mouth
              last week. After all, you can't blame the poor girl if she has
              such a generous mouth, can you?</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              I just know all you beautiful people out there have been waiting
              for Samantha's Top Ten so here it is. I must emphasise that they
              werent all seen at <i>The great Macarthy</i>.</font>
