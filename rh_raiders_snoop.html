                while business sleeps, critical corporate records are being
                revealed to outsiders with the power to pass the information on
                to competitors.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; A
                team of 21st century burglars today poses arguably the greatest
                threat to Australian business. These modern day safecrackers,
                known as &quot;hackers&quot;, are stalking the computer
                installations of some of Australia's biggest companies with
                extraordinary ease. In many instances their task is made easier
                by the general ignorance of business of their power and very
                existence.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                However, a cross-section of these hackers contacted by <i>Today's
                Computers</i> claim to have cracked the computers of such
                corporate giants as BHP, Elders-IXL, BP, Ansett, TNT, ICL and
                Telecom as well as educational institutions such as the Royal
                Melbourne Institute of Technology. When many of these companies
                were contacted they claimed no knowledge of any intrusion and
                said they thought their systems were secure. However information
                supplied by hackers allowed <i>Today's Computers</i> staff to
                easily penetrate supposedly burglar-proof computers.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; It
                seems there are very few systems, either mainframe or PC-based,
                that are completely safe. In fact, one of the easiest computers
                to break into was operated by a leading computer company.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The prospect of an intruder &quot;touring&quot; the financial
                accounts of business with the ability to change and even destroy
                the information is a concerning prospect to say the least.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Even more frightening are the &quot;virus codes&quot; which have
                been detonated in the US. These codes electronic time bombs
                which sit undetected in a computer's memory until a programmed
                time sets off the device - can completely destroy systems or
                automatically change data.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Since the computer age allowed storage of highly sensitive
                financial and operational data electronically, many computers -
                mainframes and networks of minis and micros - are at risk
                because of the sophisticated programming techniques employed by
                hackers.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Kevin Fitzgerald, a computer security consultant and executive
                director of Chisholm Institute of Technology's computer abuse
                research bureau, says it is only a matter of time before
                professional criminals move in, luring the young amateurs into
                the million dollar world of computer fraud and electronic
                espionage.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Fitzgerald, who consulted the Costigan inquiry, has details of
                more than $6.2 million in losses directly attributable to 80
                cases of computer abuse with another 70 cases of unknown loss.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; An
                exclusive survey of a group of the hackers conducted by <i>Today's
                Computers</i> revealed many stole passwords and phone numbers to
                dial up computers while on work experience at companies. Others
                obtained information from employees.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                But investigations have also revealed the existence of a
                bulletin board, an electronic message service, where the hackers
                meet to exchange phone numbers, passwords and information on
                cracking a range of computers both here and overseas.</font></p>

                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                One of their favorite visiting spots once they break into a new
                system is the passwords file. If they can nab some more
                passwords and secure a higher level of access they rate it as a
                &quot;top hack&quot;.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Hacking into business computers is just a grand game to many of
                the hackers. They've given away Dungeons and Dragons and created
                their own new game. It should be called Bulk Byte Banditry.
                Their hero is definitely David Lightman, the computer kid of the
                film, War Games.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Considering the guidance given on BBSs for the serious hacker,
                claims about the number of computers they have hacked should be
                believed. This particular board provides highly detailed
                information on a number of files which can be called up and
                studied by the trusted few.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Determined hackers can start with <i>The Hacker Notebooks - 1,
                2, and 3</i>, which might well be subtitled &quot;Everything You
                Wanted To Know About Hacking - But Were Afraid To Ask
                Telecom&quot;. Reading Hackfile 1 will also add to a hacker's
                knowledge. So will NUIS (an NUI is a Network User Identifier
                that enables a computer user to pass through Midas or Austpac to
                connect to other computers). Midas is Australia's overseas&nbsp;
                packet-switching system run by the Overseas Telecommunications
                Commission. Austpac is Australia's packet-switching network. PSS
                Gate (how to use), PSS Network (tutorial) and JANET (tutorial)
                are all there for the reading. The PSS files deal with Packet
                Switching Systems and enables a hacker to access mainframe
                computers all over Australia from the safety of his own home.
                JANET is the name of a British academic network of computers
                located at universities and polytechnics throughout the country.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; A
                17-year-old hacker who hides behind the nom-de-plume The Wizard
                (not the author of Wizard's Notebook in <i>Today's Computers</i>)
                is said to have acquired these files by gaining access to
                Minerva with a cracked ID code. He then dialled up Britain using
                his modem and got the information from a database. They are
                general &quot;help&quot; files which a legitimate user would
                have access to when logged on to a system. Minerva is an
                internationally compatible electronic mail service to link
                terminals and computers.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Four articles by The Knights of the Shadow (a group of hackers
                who achieved some notoriety in the US) deal with hacking
                introduction, hacking DECs, hacking VAX and UNIX. This
                collection of articles gives a very thorough grounding in
                hacking three of the most common mainframe computers installed
                in Australia. These articles appeared on the hackers BBS after
                some of the Australian hackers phones similar BBSs in the US and
                downloaded the information to place it on the local board.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Most hackers who answered the survey questions listed the main
                sources of their information on passwords as being other
                hackers, closed BBSs, the Minerva Hackers' Conference,
                downloading from other hackers, and &quot;friends in high
                places&quot;. Some said they had obtained passwords while on
                work experience, others claimed to have &quot;got them while
                visiting government departments and talking to
                programmers&quot;.</font></p>

                costing as little as $300&nbsp; with a $200 modem to steal their
                way
                into million dollar mainframes. Even without exact phone numbers
                they can use demon dialers - programs that repeatedly dial a
                random series of numbers until a computer responds. A similar
                program can be used to bombard computers with a series of
                passwords generated by dictionary programs until entry is
                gained, but in many cases passwords are simply guessed -
                &quot;PASS&quot; for example. The hackers claim to follow a code
                of ethics, but in practice they often appear to forget the
                rules.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Melbourne is the home of Australia's computer hackers. There are
                two hacking boards in Melbourne and the only other known ones
                are in Canberra and the Northern Territory. However, because a
                number of hackers are involved in &quot;phone phreaking&quot;
                (illegal methods of making free phone calls), distance from a
                mainframe computer is merely another challenge.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Sitting in one corner of McDonald's hamburger shop they appear
                just like any other bunch of teenage youths - but they are
                decidedly different. This group, and their absent friends,
                should be feared by many businesses which run mainframe
                computers. They are the new, young breed of computer hackers
                meeting for a HACKFEST '86.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                However, although they are depicted as super-smart by the media,
                they are not quite as clever as many Australian business people
                have been led to believe. They certainly hack into and pay
                unauthorised and unwanted visits to a number of business
                computers but they appear to lack the expertise of British and
                US hackers.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                With the co-operation of the &quot;sysop&quot; of a leading
                hacking board, this survey of Australian computer hackers has
                uncovered some interesting facts. A &quot;sysop&quot; is a
                system operator who ensures that a bulletin board being run on a
                computer is functioning in the way the program intends.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                One particular bulletin board is widely recognised among
                Victorian hackers as being the most prestigious to belong to and
                contribute to. Most members hide their identity behind names
                such as Night Stalker, Captain Hack, System Cruncher, The Dwarf,
                Phanton Phreak, and so on. Most of them live in fear of being
                apprehended by Telecom's data investigation staff. &quot;Many of
                them jump into their boxes and hide when they think Telecom is
                trying to trace them,&quot; one of the older, wilier hackers
                told me.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Although about 170 computer buffs log onto his BBS as regular
                callers with a password, fewer than 35 have been granted
                privileged access to allow them to see hidden sections of the
                board devoted to hacking. This group within the group were all
                invited to answer a questionaire about themselves and their
                hacking achievements and attitudes.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Asked to estimate the number of computer systems they had hacked
                into, 35 per cent claimed to have penetrated between 10 and 15.
                Twenty-eight per cent admitted to two to five penetrations, and
                14 per cent claimed five to 10. Seven per cent of the hackers
                claimed to have &quot;visited&quot; more than 50 computers.
                Nearly 90 per cent of the hacking is done into mainframes, with
                the remainder into PCs.</font></p>

                The Minerva Hackers' Conference, which was held on the Minerva
                system in November last year, was one of the more daring
                exploits carried out by a group of Australian hackers.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &quot;One of the hackers acquired a Minerva ID (identification
                account) and passed it on to some other users on the
                board,&quot; a participant said. &quot;They all got on about 10
                pm and went to the area called Net Talk. This is an area with a
                conferencing system where multiple users can talk to each other.
                Then they got more IDs and more user numbers and every night for
                weeks they would get on to Midas about 10 pm and wait until
                other hackers came on so they could start chatting. Bits of
                hacking information were exchanged using the facilities of
                Midas.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Business people concerned about the safety and integrity of data
                on their own computers have good reason to be worried. Hackers
                in the survey who are working occupy jobs such as computer
                programmers, computer technicians, computer operators and
                commercial data processing and technical positions in
                telecommunications corporations.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Most hackers expressed disbelief at the simplicity of many of
                the passwords they have discovered. The most common passwords
                found were a girlfriend or wife's name, part of a surname or
                company name, users' initials, the name of the computer system,
                simple groups of letters or numbers (such as ABCDE or 12345).
                Common passwords that make a hacker's job easier include such
                Golden Oldies as BOSS, DEMO, PASS, SEXY, ALPHA, OPEN, GO,
                VISITOR, MANAGER, FRED and PHONE. If you are using one of these
                tired old troopers, trade it in quickly on something more
                original.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Most passwords used by hackers do not appear to be acquired by
                skill or ingenuity. They are more often stolen or acquired by
                other means from offices. Employees either deliberately, or
                unwittingly, make them known to unauthorised users and they soon
                appear on hackers' bulletin boards.</font></p>

                Hackers go to extraordinary lengths to protect their illegally
                obtained password booty. A recent message on a hacking board
                indicates their concern:</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &quot;Just watch out what you do on Minerva. If the accounts
                come in and out as you guys have said, then I suggest you
                exercise extreme caution. I was traced once from Minerva, after
                I incorrectly typed in the ID. I switched off quickly though.
                Just be careful . . . that's how The Knights of the Shadow were
                caught (I think).&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Other messages on the same BBS gave surprisingly detailed
                information on how Telecom can do a phone trace on everyone who
                logs on to Austpac or Midas.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                One of the cunning tricks used by local hackers is called
                &quot;the decoy&quot;. When they have acquired a low level
                account on a computer system they aim to upgrade this to a
                higher level. What they do is to write a program which appears
                to be the log-on procedure of the computer they have penetrated.
                This program is written to appear just as the computer system
                usually does when a registered user logs on. It then prompts the
                user for an account name and password. This information is then
                saved where the hacker can retrieve it later. The innocent user
                is then advised the&nbsp;</font></p>

                More than 60 per cent of the hackers were aged between 16 and
                18, while another 20 per cent were between 22-25. Only six per
                cent were over 30. The biggest group, 50 per cent, had reached
                year 11 at school, with the next biggest group being 21 per cent
                who had reached year 10. Those who had done more than 12 years
                schooling were next, comprising 14 per cent of the group.
                Ninety-three per cent of the respondents said they were males.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                It took 12 to 18 months of using computers before 21 per cent
                attempted to hack into a system, but 14 per cent started hacking
                after three to six months and another 14 per cent after six to
                12 months. In their first three months of computing, seven per
                cent started hacking into other people's computers. The
                majority, 42 per cent, didn't start hacking until after 18
                months.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Most of the hackers use very simple home computers. Apple is the
                most popular, followed closely by the inexpensive Commodore C64
                and Tandy's TRS models. The modems used are the cheapest
                available, costing about $200.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                To search out unlisted phone numbers of business computers most
                hackers use a simple computer program, written in Basic, called
                the <i>Demon Dialler</i>. This program allows a hacker to dial a
                selected group of telephone numbers and record when the carrier
                tone of a computer modem is detected.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Hackers refuse to disclose details of the information they read
                and study when they &quot;visit&quot; business computers. One of
                them said: &quot;We only share our knowledge with other hackers,
                not reporters. Why should we supply you with information you
                want and watch everything dry up.&quot;</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Messages on the BBS to other hackers highlight the extent of
                their paranoia, even when communicating with people they know
                and trust. They admit that they could easily download any
                information which</font></td>

                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> details are not acceptable. At this point
                the legitimate computer system is put in charge of the terminal
                again. Most users will think they have mistyped some of the
                information. When they try again the system logs them on. The
                hacker arrives later and collects new passwords.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; A
                recent message on the board indicates how seriously most hackers
                try to cover their unauthorised entries into computers. One of
                the hackers wrote to fellow hackers: &quot;I shouldn't need to
                remind you that it's far better to stalk a system than to wreck
                it and hack it openly (p/w's don't last long like that!) If you
                don't understand . . . when you get into a system act like a spy
                would and tread softly! And if you lot don't behave we'll have
                to tighten access to this board, SO BE WARNED!&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The hacker &quot;code of ethics&quot; consists of three points:</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.
                No hacker will ever delete or damage information that belongs to
                a legitimate user of the system in any way that the hacker
                cannot easily correct.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.
                No hacker will leave another hacker's name or phone number on
                any computer system. He will leave his own on a system only at
                his own risk.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.
                All hackers are expected to obtain and contribute their own
                account information.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Most hackers follow these rules most of the time, because: (a)
                They would like to keep the account information they went to so
                much trouble to get; (b) They would like to stay out of legal
                trouble, if possible; (c) They like computers and don't have any
                reason to cause trouble to them or for the people who run them;
                (d) They love the elaborate, complex logic of computer systems.
                People who find pleasure in destroying data are not motivated by
                love of the system or by respect for other hackers.</font></td>

        1985 and 1986 I became increasingly interested in the exploits and
        diverse skill of a number of computer hackers and phone phreaks I had
        made friends with in Melbourne, Australia. With the co-operation of the
        Sysop of a hackers’ bulletin board, I arranged to do a survey aimed at
        measuring the activities of this group. I was surprised at the amount of
        information they were willing to disclose. This survey and my own
        independent observations made on this BBS and others devoted to hacking
        provided the detail needed for this article.
        <p align="justify">When the article appeared I chose not to have my name associated with
        it. For personal reasons, I did not want to bring myself to the
        attention of Telecom Australia, later to change its name to Telstra
        Corporation Ltd!
