        <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DARLINGS, I'm sure
        you'll all be abuzz to know that the naughty Melbourne social set is
        trying to ostracise little me since I told on them at the film festival.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear old
        Roadshow and Rebelez films had me scrubbed off the list of snooty silver
        invitations to the Palais premiere of <i>Borsalino &amp; Co</i> on
        sunday. But sweeties, you can't keep this Cinderella indoors when
        there's sparkle in the air. So I jumped the Honda and bopped down to
        Palais <i>sur la mer</i> and came down with the needful three dollars
        myself. Inside I found the poor common people were rudely herded into
        the stalls and the beautiful people (<i>with invitations</i>) were
        upstairs guzzling the champers and preening themselves in the most
        gauche style.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; After
        evading the V dashing ushers guarding the staircase I managed to
        elegantly intrude myself alongside Freddy and Francine Freeloader.
        Bliss. Gazing idly around the balcony I did notice Sharmill Films'
        Natalie Miller, so I hid behind a pillar - I didnt want her to see me
        after what I wrote about her. Then I saw David Johnston of HSV7 and I
        must say he does look much shorter off the box. (Pardon the expression).</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Gerald Lyons, onetime TV interviewer and talkback guru, and now PR king
        for the Royal Melbourne hospital looked absolutely splendid in his grey
        flannel suit. V. appropriate.</font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        ABC stalwarts Kevin Arnett and Philip Nelson looked so spiffy in the
        trendy's uniform of black leather jacket and chunky platform soled
        shoes. Whilst they were chatting away another chappie walked up. I
        nearly fainted when one of them said to him: &quot;Hello Blossom, where
        have you been?&quot; What a V amazing nickname!!</font></td>

      <td valign="top" align="left" width="345">
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Verdana" size="2">One of my
        favorite characters for the evening was the rather large lady wearing a
        grey pinafore with multicolored chevron stripes on the yoke and the hem.
        She seemed rather keen on asian dishes, if you know what I mean
        darlings.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; A number
        of nonentities had gone to the trouble of dressing up for <i>Borsalino
        &amp; Co</i> in blazers, straw boaters, trenchcoats and caps etc. V
        boring. V type.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin
        Bennett, the feared film critic from the <i>Age</i> came sans his trusty
        gabardine raincoat. he swept into the foyer wearing dusty pink cords,
        baby blue skivvy and a chestnut brown jacket. Colin showed how smart he
        was by scorning the bourgeoisie up on the balcony. he indicated to the
        ushers that he preferred to sit in the stalls with the workers. Up the
        working class!</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Most
        marvellous comment on the evening was made by the woman wearing a new
        length skirt in muted pinks, a white sweater with 1920s ladies motif
        printed on the front, V long brown squashy boots and a brown tooled
        leather shoulder bag large enough to carry a week's tucker in. Whilst
        talking to her male companion she put a delicate hand to her derriere.
        I'm not sure whether she was checking the disposition of her
        unmentionables or if she imagined that one of those nasty bottom
        pinching Italians had got in early. I hope I see her again. <i>She'll</i>
        get more free invites.</font></td>
