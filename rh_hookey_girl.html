          <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some
          parents will probably be surprised to hear that when I found out that
          my daughter Danielle had wagged school one day last week, I was at
          first surprised at the news, then delighted at her initiative.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Dan, who
          hates to be called Danielle, is almost 17, and my wife and I have
          always encouraged her to be independent. She buys her own clothes,
          organises her own banking and, like most teenagers, tends to talk for
          hours on the phone. She likes Roy Harper, 3RRR, Redgum, Virginia
          Ferguson, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles and The Minstrel. She wants to buy
          a new guitar. She is left handed. 'Like Hendrix, Dad'.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
          first I knew that she had wagged school was when a friend phoned me at
          my office and said that he had seen Dan going down Bourke Street near
          Russell Street carrying a shopping bag from Gaslight Records. Because
          she had been spotted around 11 am in the city, when she should have
          been at school in Croydon, it was obvious that Dan had moved across
          town with determination.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; That
          morning she was dropped, as usual, at Mitcham railway station to
          travel to Croydon and school. I later found out that she crossed the
          line, bought a return ticket to Melbourne and hit out for the Golden
          Mile and a day in the record shops.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
          object of all this effort was to buy an LP record by Roy Harper called
          'One of Those Days In England', which Dan had only spotted at Gaslight
          Records. Harper is not on the Top Ten, Twenty, Forty or Hundred but
          she likes him and now has about eight of about 13 available LPs.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a rock
          music reference Harper is a 40-year-old Manchester-born megalomanic
          rock-singing guitarist with a distinctive guitar style. Wrinklies like
          me will probably be fascinated to know that he is one rock musician
          who openly admits to having received ECT treatment. That happened
          after he faked</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">mental illness
          to
          bring</font></p>
        </td>

        <td align="left" width="345" valign="top">
          <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">about his release from the RAF. Roy Harper became the new
          magnificent obsession when Dan had collected almost every record ever
          released by Jimi Hendrix.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> When she
          was met at Mitcham Station in the afternoon Dan arrived from Croydon
          as if she had been to school, but we couldn't help noticing the record
          bag from Gaslight inadequately hidden in her schoolbag.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon
          as she arrived home she went straight to her room and started playing
          her latest Roy Harper record. Asked where she got it, she quickly
          admitted that she had wagged school so that she could travel into the
          city to buy it.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Dan was
          quite proud of herself as she told us how she travelled and did
          everything for herself, including finding her way from Flinders Street
          Station to the top of Bourke Street and Gaslight Records. 'It's the
          first time I've ever made all the arrangements and gone somewhere all
          on my own', she said.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; After
          buying the record she went around to Missing Link Records in Flinders
          Lane and listened to records and checked the stock bins. Having been
          given a couple of Jimi Hendrix posters at Missing Link, Dan went back
          to Flinders Street Station and caught the train to Croydon and waited
          for her school friends to join her on the journey back to Mitcham.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; If it
          wasn't for my friend spotting her in Bourke Street, I might not have
          known the full story. Dan was assisted in wagging school by a number
          of kindly people. Thanks are due to the VicRail porters and guards,
          the folks at Missing Link and Gaslight record shops, and most of all
          to the kind man who was a bit early for his appointment with his city
          dentist last week.</font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He told
          Dan he was early, and he pushed her wheelchair as she trundled up the
          Bourke Street hill from Russell Street.</font></p>
