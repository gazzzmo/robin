        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Bob Burt reviewed
        the first release of the Corel All-Movie Guide (<i>PC Update</i>,
        November 1995) it was described by Corel as &quot;The Ultimate Guide to
        the Movies.&quot; Having spent over a day investigating the second
        release, I think it is wise that Corel has dropped that claim now.</font></p>

        titles.</i></font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                That line has been replaced by the blander statement
                &quot;100,000 Movies and Video References on CD-ROM.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Having access to such an extensive repository of information is
                absolutely irresistible to a dedicated film fan like me - who
                regularly visits the Internet Movie Database site on the www
                checking on details of films old and new.</font></p>
                <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Installation</b></p>
                <p align="justify">Installing the program via Windows 95 is
                effortless and if you have the auto-run feature enabled you just
                need to click the Run button to load the program. Then you are
                at the Video Store, which gives you access to all the search
                facilities in the Corel All-Movie Guide 2 (<span style="font-variant: small-caps"><b>CAMG2</b></span>)</p>
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; The interface to the program is
                far from intuitive and is rather reminiscent of a &quot;Magical
                Mystery Tour.&quot; For instance, the Information monitor takes
                you to a list of all the movies in the database. A poster to the
                right of the popcorn machine accesses a list of all movies that
                are accompanied by a movie poster or photograph. Click on the
                monitor to the left of the Information monitor and it'll display
                a list of all the famous people in the database and their
                photos. Other objects hide other information which can be
                ascertained by placing the mouse cursor over them. This is all
                explained in the accompanying booklet, but in use appears
                involved and not user friendly. This contrasts with a
                competitive product I often use, which has a well-designed and
                logical interface.</p>
                <p><b>Categories</b></p>
                <p align="justify">When you want information on a particular
                type of film you choose from the 16 categories on the video
                shelf display to see the full list of each. The categories are
                Features, Recent, Horror, Documentary, Television, Action,
                Comedy, Drama, Mystery, SciFi, Classics, Western, Crime, War,
                Children and Music.</p>
                <p><b>Reliability test</b></p>
                <p align="justify">To test the reliability and comprehensiveness
                of <span style="font-variant: small-caps"><b>CAMG2</b></span>, I
                first carried out a key word search for &quot;Aborigine&quot;
                and the program claimed it could only find 25 occurrences.
                Looking through the films listed, it was immediately apparent to
                me that one of Australia's most under-rated films which deals
                with the tragedy of our local Aborigines was not found. Although
                <i>The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith</i>  is in the database, the
                keyword search had not located it. It did manage to remind me of
                many other fine films like <i>Manganinnie</i>, <i>Jedda</i>, <i>The
                Last Shout</i>  and <i>Romper Stomper</i>.</p>
        <p><img border="0" src="rh_corel6.jpg" alt="Figure 5. Some entries have associated stills." width="345" height="381"><br>
                <font face="Verdana" size="1"><i>Figure 5. Some entries have
                associated stills.</i></font></p>
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the 25 films listed only 12
                matched the keyword &quot;Aborigine&quot;. The other 13, or just
                over 50 percent appear to me to have no connection with
                Australia and its aborigines. These included such rib-ticklers
                as the 1956 USA drama <i>Storm Center</i>, starring Bette Davis;
                the <i>Frisbee Disc</i>  video, The <i>Vacation
                from Italy</i>  and <i>Under The Sun of Rome</i>.</p>
                <p><b>Australia</b>
                <p align="justify">Because Australian films and their directors
                are making an impact worldwide, I decided to do a further test.
                Doing a keyword search for &quot;Australia&quot; I was
                interested to see 224 occurrences listed. Perusing the titles
                thrown up made me think I must have mistyped the word, so I
                entered it again. Same result - and so many of them were both
                quirky and unreliable.</p>
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; It listed films from all over
                the world that appear to have no connection whatsoever with
                Australia. These included such weird suggestions as the <i>Everley Brothers Reunion Concert</i>,
                a documentary shot at the Royal Albert Hall, a 1938 USA film <i>Start
                Cheering</i>, the 1973 French film <i>La Grande Boueffe</i>, <i>Backpacking
                America</i>, <i>I Pagliacci</i>, <i>Montana</i>  (a USA Western)
                and the USA comedy <i>Cactus Flower</i>  starring Goldie Hawn.
                But there were some notable exclusions. It did <b>not</b>  find <i>The
                Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith</i>  nor the film <i>Vacant Possession</i>,
                although both are in the database and mention
                &quot;Australia&quot; in the plot outlines!</p>

                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet it did list <i>Under

                Ranger</i>, <i>Waltz Time</i>  and <i>Storm Centre</i>  in this

                movies in the list, although there are a number of notable

                <p align="justify">Concerned that there may be some feature in  <span style="font-variant: small-caps"><b>CAMG2</b></span>
                that I misunderstood, I e-mailed Corel in Canada explaining the
                problems I had unearthed with the keyword search function and
                asked if they were aware of its limitations.</p>
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; Corel replied, &quot;The problem
                you asked about has to do with the Database. If the word you are
                searching has not been entered as a keyword then it will not
                come up in the search. This means that if a word appears in the
                plot outline but is not entered as a keyword it will also not
                come up in a search. If movies come up that seem to have nothing
                to do with the search word it may be that the word was
                incorrectly entered as a keyword for that movie. These are
                problems with the database which we license from All-Movie
                Guide. We make sure to pass on all the errors which have been
                reported,</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">and I will pass
                on yours.&quot;</p>
                <p><b>Further tests</b></p>
                <p align="justify">After reading this reply I decided to look
                more thoroughly into the Australian content of the <b><span style="font-variant: small-caps">CD-ROM</span></b>.
                The 224 titles in the keyword search includes that 70s sex romp <i>Alvin
                Purple</i>, but does not list <i>Alvin Purple Rides Again</i>.
                Both are in the database and acknowledged as Australian films!</p>
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; To see how up-to-date it is I
                searched and found a synopsis of <i>Vacant
                Possession</i>, which was not available at the <i>Internet Movie
                Database</i>  (<span style="font-variant: small-caps"><b>imd</b></span>)
                <a href="http://us.imdb.com/">http://us.imdb.com/</a>.
                Looking for the latest Australian movie releases using the
                timeline feature unearthed <i>Shine</i>  (1996) and <i>Angel Baby</i>
                (1995).</p>
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; Reading about our own director
                Gillian Armstrong, I was disappointed to find that in giving
                details of some of her films her name is spelt <i>Gilliam</i>.
                In discussing her first short film <i>The Singer and The Dancer</i>,
                the Guide gives the year it was made as both 1976 and 1977. A
                similar annoying error is made with New Zealander Jane Campion's
                internationally acclaimed
                <i>The Piano</i>. We are told it was made in 1992 and 1993. The
                correct year is 1993.</p>

      <b>Conclusions</b>
      <p align="justify">If you want a huge database of film and video from
      which to choose &quot;a nice night's home viewing&quot;, <b><span style="font-variant: small-caps">camg2</span></b>
      will throw up lots of information to allow you to select from a range of
      categories. If you are a serious film buff who wants accurate, reliable
      information about films, directors, films from particular countries and
      keyword searches you can rely on, you may need to investigate other
      sources of information. Greater attention to checking detail and
      proofreading the information already contained in the database is needed
      before <b><span style="font-variant: small-caps">camg2</span></b>
      becomes a &quot;Must Buy&quot; for me.</p>
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; One advantage for buyers is that
                quarterly updates to the Guide are available on the Internet.
                The first one is already online and contains information on over
