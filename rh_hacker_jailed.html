              Christopher William McDonald, 19, of Arabin Street, Keilor, was
              sentenced to 12 months jail in the Melbourne Magistrate's Court.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He was
              convicted of dishonestly obtaining by deception a computer from
              Computerscore.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He was
              ordered to serve three months of the sentence immediately, with
              nine months suspended.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              McDonald pleaded guilty to 20 charges of obtaining property by
              deception and attempting to obtain property by deception.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He also
              pleaded guilty to three charges of using the telephone to menace
              and harass police officers.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              court was told by the police prosecutor, Sergeant Mick Berkley,
              that McDonald had ordered $18,705 worth of goods by using credit
              card numbers belonging to other people.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              offences took place between 1 July and 17 September last year.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Sergeant Berkley said that McDonald and two other men, who still
              had to appear in court, had obtained valid credit card numbers
              from various sources.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave
              details of the array of goods McDonald illegally obtained from
              suppliers.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; This
              included electronic equipment from Dick Smith Electronics in
              Sydney, almost 300 tickets from the BASS agency for concerts,
              including Simply Red and Billy Idol, limousine hire and flowers.</font></p>
              <p align="justify">
              <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details
              were also given about McDonald's appearance on the 'Willesee'
              program, recorded on 19 June last year.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He had
              been shown contacting a United States hacker by phone to check
              details of credit cards.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Sergeant Berkley said that McDonald had obtained the silent home
              phone numbers and addresses of three detectives involved in
              handling the case against&nbsp;him and two other men.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              court was also told that the defendant believed that he could not
              be caught because the police did not have the facilities to apprehend him.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr
              Michael Rush, defending McDonald, said that one could see a
              sophistication in this case &quot;but a great deal of
              immaturity&quot;. He said his client left school at Form 4 at St
              Bernard's Essendon.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He
              first became involved with computers at Assumption College,
              Kilmore.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              &quot;The hobby has become a fixation for him,&quot; he said.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He
              said he had been instructed that the co-accused in the case had
              been granted an adjournment and was going to plead guilty.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              The court was
              told that McDonald had been listening to the co-accused who made
              threatening phone calls to the three detectives.</font>

              <p align="justify">
              <font face="Verdana" size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp; (At the Melbourne Magistrate's Court earlier in the
              day, John Halkiadakis, also known as &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;, was
              called before Mr John Duggan, chief magistrate, on the same
              charges as McDonald. His case was set for a relisting on 10 May to
              allow him time to instruct legal counsel for his defence. Bail was
              extended until that day.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              defendant's father, Mr J. A. McDonald, a cartage contractor, told
              the court that his son was the one of the six children who, until
              recently, had always been the best behaved.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> &nbsp;&nbsp; He
              said the first problem with him had been when he got a big phone
              bill as a result of his computer usage.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; They
              had a row and his son went to live with a 29-year-old computer
              enthusiast who had been a bad influence on him.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He said his son was
              &quot;an addict&quot;. He would use computers daily and nightly if
              he had the time. &quot;He just thought he was smart … He thought
              he wouldn't get caught.&quot;</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The court was told that McDonald
              had not had any contact with the other co-accused since&nbsp;charges
              were laid against them.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; It was
              also told that McDonald's father had been in hospital following a
              heart attack since his son committed the offences.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Referring to the &quot;sophistication shown in the offences&quot;,
              Mr Rush said that the bravado and immaturity were such that his
              client should be seen by a psychiatrist.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; After
              adjourning the court to consider the case, Mr Rowan McIndoe said
              that there were 20 offences of financial dishonesty involving
              nearly $19,000 committed in less than a month. Less than half the
              proceeds had been recovered.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              &quot;The operation has been sophisticated, if not precocious or
              arrogant,&quot; he said.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He also
              referred to the extent of the offences, the range of them and the
              perceived impudence with which they had been carried out.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              &quot;The sophistication, the deliberateness of them, should be
              met by a term of imprisonment served right now,&quot; he said.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr
              McIndoe convicted McDonald on the charge of dishonestly obtaining
              a computer by deception. He was sentenced to 12 months jail, with
              nine months suspended.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; On the
              other 19 charges of attempting to obtain property by deception and
              obtaining property by deception, he was jailed for one month.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
              to be served concurrently.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; On the
              three charges of using the telephone to menace and harass a police
              officer, he was fined $600.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              magistrate also ordered McDonald to pay restitution to four of his
              victims.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; To the
              BASS ticket agency he is to pay $4500, Astra Hire Cars $3551,
