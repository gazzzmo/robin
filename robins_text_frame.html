quotes[1] = "Fiction is based on reality unless you're a fairytale artist. You have got to get your knowledge of life from somewhere. You have to know the material you're writing about before you alter it. -- Hunter S. Thompson";
quotes[2] = "Murdoch has contempt for journalism. He wants all news to be a matter of opinion. Opinion can't be proven false. That's very dangerous because if people don't have a set of facts that they can agree on then its difficult to reach consensus on what's correct public policy. -- David Brock, head of Media Matters for America";
quotes[3] = "I don't spin. I just think that's a stupid term.-- Kerrina Lawrence, Telstra, senior media manager";
quotes[4] = "The curious fact is that while the press at least enjoys abundant resources, the actual amount of original reporting is declining. And the influence and self confidence of the senior journalists has rarely been lower. -- Chris Anderson, 2004 Andrew Olle Media Lecture";
quotes[5] = "Gonzo journalism is a style of reporting based on William Faulkner's idea that the best fiction is far more true than any kind of journalism - and the best journalists have always known this. -- Hunter S. Thompson";
quotes[6] = "Of course, while business criticizes reporters for getting it wrong or missing the point, it employs an army of flaks and corporate affairs people to suppress or manipulate the corporate news - mostly successfully. My old enemy, Telstra, has nearly 300 devoted in some way to the task. -- Chris Anderson, 2004 Andrew Olle Media Lecture";
quotes[7] = "Freedom of speech means people are free to say what they believe; free to speak openly, even if their views are from some perspectives unfair; even if their arguments are not balanced but contrived to put the best possible spin on what they say; and even if the information they draw on is not accurate. -- Mark Day";
quotes[8] = "That's what John Howard will be remembered for, in our opinion. Having trashed the Westminster system of government, he's now threatening whatever is left of the principles of journalism. -- Charles Wright";
quotes[9] = "When in doubt, find out, and if you can't find out, leave out. -- Freda Irving, journalist, The Argus";
quotes[10] = "Absolute truth is a very rare and dangerous commodity in the context of professional journalism. -- Hunter S. Thompson";
quotes[11] = "In the press, I believe it is time to redress the tilt to lifestyle journalism. The newsprint and staff needs should be reviewed. The offer of a free page of advertorialish journalism to get a wine ad needs a rethink. -- Chris Anderson, 2004 Andrew Olle Media Lecture";
quotes[12] = "You (reporters) should have printed what he meant, not what he said. -- Earl Bush";
quotes[13] = "Trying to determine what is going on in the world by reading newspapers is like trying to tell the time by watching the second hand of a clock. -- Ben Hecht";
quotes[14] = "The public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything. Except what is worth knowing. Journalism, conscious of this, and having tradesman-like habits, supplies their demands. -- Oscar Wilde";
quotes[15] = "The difference between literature and journalism is that journalism is unreadable and literature is not read. -- Oscar Wilde";
quotes[16] = "Journalism is merely history's first draft. -- Geoffrey C. Ward";
quotes[17] = "Journalism consists largely in saying 'Lord Jones died' to people who never knew Lord Jones was alive. -- Gilbert Keith Chesterton";
quotes[18] = "Radio news is bearable. This is due to the fact that while the news is being broadcast the disc jockey is not allowed to talk. -- Fran Lebowitz";
quotes[19] = "Its failings notwithstanding, there is much to be said in favour of journalism in that by giving us the opinion of the uneducated, it keeps us in touch with the ignorance of the community. -- Unknown";
quotes[20] = "I believe in equality for everyone, except reporters and photographers. -- Mahatma Gandhi";
quotes[21] = "Journalists are generally reasonably adept at thinking, and joining the dots, but sometimes you have to worry about the leaps of logic. -- Mark Day";
quotes[22] = "Journalists' reputations will always be made by being fair and accurate. -- Eddie McGuire";
quotes[23] = "WHY is the greatest three-letter word in the journalistic world. You'll never go broke as a journalist if you ask the question why. -- George Negus";
quotes[24] = "News Corporation's roots, heart and culture are unmistakably Australian. -- Rupert Murdoch, as he moves News Corp to the New York Stock Exchange and the tax-lax state of Delaware!";
quotes[25] = "I have often wondered what to call the mush that fills the women's mags. It's not journalism, because that implies a commitment to the truth. The focus discussions may have identified a proper description of the genre - modern day comics. -- Mark Day";
quotes[26] = "Nation Review emerged as the old Liberal Government - prior to Gough - was dying. And we emerged as Gough emerged. And the people I worked with there, they were brilliant journalists. They were very experienced, colourful people. Really dynamic, funny people. And I miss them dearly to this day. -- Michael Leunig";
quotes[27] = "If journalism is said to be the first draft of history, it can also be said to be sometimes slapdash, sometimes superficial, or wrongly slanted. That's because reporters are more interested in recording the who, what, when and why of life, rather than writing an academic treatise. -- Mark Day";
quotes[28] = "I think journalism is so full of doubletalk and charming words, and people not saying what they mean. -- Michael Leunig";
quotes[29] = "But Vic (V.J. Carroll of the Sydney Morning Herald) was passionate about the truth - still is; and about the need to question the certainties and to puncture the pomposity of both the right and the left. -- Chris Anderson, 2004 Andrew Olle Media Lecture";
quotes[30] = "In the past year, I cannot recall a single occasion when New Idea contacted my wife, who represents Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe, to check information. I guess it's a case of being afraid the facts would ruin a good made-up story. -- Mark Day";
quotes[31] = "Ask tough questions. Think about the spin - and go beyond it. -- Helen Thomas, doyen of the White House Press Corp.";
