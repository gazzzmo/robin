                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is late at
                night. The reports have started to come in of mysterious
                sightings of an exciting BBS seen hovering over Victoria.
                Triffid and I enter the Scitec time capsule with trepidation...
                we are about to enter The Outer Limits.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Faster than the speed of light we are there. Captain Kirk greets
                us in a strange language. His space craft takes control of my
                monitor. . . I have lost control. Triffid squeals with delight.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Captain Kirk (Peter Dorrell) started the Outer Limits BBS on
                September 1. It is dedicated to science fiction, fantasy and
                horror.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &quot;The name of the BBS and the opening logo of the
                'ENTERPRISE' come from the television show from the sixties,
                Star Trek, which happens to be my favorite,&quot; Dorrell says.
                &quot;I thought there was a need for something different in the
                way of BBS and having a great love for S.F. and computers, I
                decided to join the two together and share it with others.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                There are about 150 users and around 60 of these log on
                regularly. Only three per cent are women. On average, there are
                10 callers a day and about 40 at weekends. Most people spend
                about 40 minutes on the board.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The message areas are alive with discussion on science fiction,
                fantasy, television and books. In message area two, Captain Kirk
                gives details of new film releases coming up and such things as
                Video Top 20 and what is &quot;watchable&quot; on television
                this week.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Students or hobbyists, who are into sci-fi, either through
                books, film or fantasy role playing games, are the big
                contributors with messages coming from such characters as
                Mithrandir Grey, The Griblet, Zaphod, Wenlock Burton, Gandalf
                the-grey, Vivamort, Admiral Korg and Proton. If you are
                interested in books like Chapter House of Dune, authors like
                Isaac Asimov, E.E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith, Michael Moorcock,
                Douglas Adams, Robert Heinlen, Larry Niven, H.P. Lovecraft, or
                Philip Jose Farmer then you had better visit The Outer&nbsp;Limits soon.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &quot;I think BBSs are going to get bigger and better in the
                near future,&quot; Dorrell says. &quot;However, they will
                diversify into different interest groups, unlike what they are
                now. At the moment BBSs are used just to exchange computer
                related information, but I think people will turn to them for
                entertainment such as on-line games, multi-user games etc.&quot;</font></p>

                works at a window manufacturers and his work does not include
                the use of computers, which are only a hobby for him. In his
                spare time he enjoys watching a good science fiction film, or
                reading a book.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most popular sections of The Outer Limits is the
                serialised story called, &quot;Just Imagine Jeanie&quot;. New
                episodes are added at regular intervals.&nbsp;</font></p>

                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> This is the first of
                many stories planned for the BBS. The first episodes can be
                found in the IBMPC file section; just type &quot;T&quot; from
                the file menu, then type &quot;JEANIE.TXT&quot;, and the first
                episodes will print out.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Here is a quick guide to travelling The Outer Limits. From the
                main menu.<br>
                <br>
                (TYPE M): Message area to read about new film releases and
                general information.<br>
                (TYPE A): Try your sci-fi knowledge with the trivia quiz; there
                is a prize to be won every month.<br>
                (TYPE E): Read episodes of Just Imagine Jeanie.<br>
                (TYPE F): Download science fiction programs.<br>
                (TYPE Y): Communicate with Captain Kirk.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The sci-fi trivia quiz and the serialised stories are both very
                popular. Dorrell is hoping to expand these areas soon and also
                plans to have on-line games, including adventures to play. A
                downloadable manual is not available.</font></p>
