                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just
                inside the front door of the grand municipal gothic South
                Melbourne town hall is a plaque that should have been read by
                all the delegates to last week's ACTU congress. It should also
                have been read by that keen student of history Gough Whitlam before he made his
                flamboyant entry at precisely 2.30 pm last
                thursday.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The plaque records
                that the town hall occupies the original site of the Melbourne
                Orphanage Asylum. Founded 1855 - vacated 1878 - says the plaque
                quite bluntly. With 23 years of continuous operation the
                Melbourne Orphanage Asylum looks like turning out to be a more
                consistent performer than the Labor government.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Although the
                inmates had well and truly taken over the asylum last week with
                around 750 delegates in attendance from monday to friday, it was
                thursday that was to present the best case studies of parental
                deprivation.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Not only were the
                delegates waiting for Whitlam's speech, they were also standing
                by for the decision of the arbitration commission on the future
                of wage indexation. Congress had decided to defer a decision on
                its wages policy until after the judgment was given at 10.30 am.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                After three days
                of congress the South Melbourne town hall was beginning to look
                tired and traumatised. When thursday's session commenced the
                palms, conifers and potted flowers covered in artificial grass
                on stage looked as hungover as some of the delegates.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Bob Hawke was
                properly proletariat in his brown slacks, grey sportscoat and
                green and grey tie. Sitting behind Hawke on stage, Brian
                Harradine looked as if he believed he was running the congress.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                During a debate on
                shipping and shipbuilding in Australia, at 10.55 am, a delegate interrupts the speaker to advise Hawke that the arbitration commission has announced a 3.5 percent increase and a $2.80
                increase in the minimum wage, to apply from the first pay period
                from today. Momentarily upstaged by the faster intelligence from
                the&nbsp; floor, Hawke tells the delegates that he has arranged for
                copies of the complete judgment to be obtained from the
                commission. He expects them to arrive about 11.15.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                At 11.14 Harradine
                and others start distributing the commission's decision whilst a
                motion on uranium mining is being debated. A constant buzzing
                begins as delegates discuss the decision above the AMWU delegate
                from Mt Isa, who tries to speak about the dangers of uranium
                mining.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                South Melbourne
                town hall clock starts striking noon when Jack Devereux says, on
                behalf of the ACTU executive, that they have looked at the
                decision of the arbitration commission and see no reason why
                they should depart from their resolution regarding wage
                indexation. &quot;We must keep in mind that our first
                responsibility is to our members,&quot; says Jack. The executive
                wages resolution ran to two typed foolscap pages.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                At 12.12, while
                Devereux is still talking, John Halfpenny, the Victorian
                secretary of the AMWU, comes up on stage to talk to Hawke for
                two minutes. As he leaves, Hawke lights up a huge cigar that
                looks worthy of any member of the Melbourne Club.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Around 12.22 Hawke
                proposes that congress adjourn to consider the arbitration
                commission's decision. He suggests discussing the decision after
                the lunch adjournment before the prime minister addresses them.
                Which seems a nursemaid's manner of stopping the babies from
                crying.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just 2pm - 15
                minutes before congress is to start and 30 minutes before
                Whitlam is due. As you walk to the area in front of the stage
                set aside for the media, the whole scene has changed. Before
                lunch there were 21 media representatives from press and radio
                and none from TV. Now there are a cluster of 22 frenetic TV news
                reporters, cameramen setting up a bewildering array of microphones around the speaker's lectern. Cameras, tripods and lights
                litter every inch of the media space.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> John Jost and
                Peter Cole-Adams of the <i>Age</i>, John Monks the <i>Herald</i>, John
                Boland, Paul Barbour, Ralph Neill, even Peter Harvey of <i>Federal
                file</i> have all come to see how Labor's fluffy, greyhaired
                father is going to manage his 750 outspoken orphans.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Right on 2.30
                Whitlam strides confidently in from the back of the hall
                preceded by TV cameras and press photographers. &quot;Here comes
                the Big Bastard,&quot; says one of the Canberra press gallery.
                &quot;Where's the other bastard?&quot; asks his colleague. The
                polite applause continues as Whitlam makes his way on stage.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Hawke introduces
                Whitlam and the fun begins as the BB starts to talk into the
                muster of 11 microphones. No one can hear him. Hawke comes back
                and fiddles with different microphones whilst Whitlam keeps
                saying &quot;Mr president&quot; into different ones.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Hawke says to
                Whitlam: &quot;You're too bloody tall, that's the problem,&quot;
                Whitlam is given a
                mike from a nearby table and is forced to hand hold it while
                delivering his speech. Looking at Whitlam in his single breasted
                grey suit (almost as
              well tailored as the suit communist John Halfpenny wears the next
              day)&nbsp;you can't help noting how florid his face and neck
              are.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              theme of his speech is to appeal for solidarity and cooperation between
                unionists and the Labor government. After
              talking about the worldwide problems of inflation and unemployment, father Whitlam tells his orphans just how lucky they
              are to have&nbsp; him&nbsp; for&nbsp; a&nbsp; dad.&nbsp; &quot;The Australian</font></p>

              measure of protection which few governments overseas, and
              certainly no previous Australian government, has accorded the
              worker in difficult times,&quot; he thunders. A little later he
              said; &quot;Above all, we need the cooperation and goodwill of the trade union movement. We have had
              that cooperation before. As the head of the Australian Labor
              government I seek and expect that cooperation now. Too much is at
              stake, too much will be lost, if that cooperation is denied
              us.&quot;</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Father
              Whitlam continues: &quot;There was the opposition's newly revealed
              industrial policy - largely Mr Fraser's own brainchild - with its
              sinister apparatus of penal clauses and union intimidation. This
              is not mere speculation on my part: it is spelt out in the
              speeches and statements of the opposition. It is the workers of
              Australia who would be caught with their pants down if The Prefect
              got his way.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              Dad
              then tells his ungrateful little orphans how kind he had been to
              them with his tax reforms and the treats he'd given them in
              health, education, transport, legal aid, social security and the
              rest. And just for one moment I thought I heard Oliver asking for
              more.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              In
              conclusion, father pulls out all stops on the town hall organ.
              &quot;Unity is needed on essentials and by this congress unity on
              essentials has been achieved. I count that an immense step
              forward. That unity is the basis of my optimism. We can now go on
              to complete our reforms, to build the prosperity of the Australian
              people, to create a more just and decent society.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              &quot;Remember the alternatives. They are all too clear; they are
              all too ugly. They are not just a return to a more complacent
              past, they mean the reduction or destruction of everything this
              government and our movement have fought to achieve... The price of
              that destruction would be paid by the working men and women of
              Australia. It is a price we cannot afford. It is a price we will
              not pay.&quot;</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Whitlam
              comes down from the stage to leave the hall and he's met by his
              security shadow and David Solomon, his press secretary. As he
              leaves the hall, Kevin Childs of the <i>Sunday press</i> times the
              applause.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I
              make it 27 seconds,&quot; says Kevin. &quot;Fraser only got 12
              seconds at the annual luncheon of the Victorian Council of Social
              Service at Olympic Park.&quot;</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
              &quot;This is a bloody good reception the Big Bastard's
              getting,&quot; says the cynical Canberra correspondent, who seems
              swept up in the enthusiasm too, standing on his seat watching
              Whitlam leave the hall.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Even
              while Whitlam is going, the TV troubadors start packing and
              trampling out. Only the serious media stay to see the congress
              through.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; John
              Jost and Peter Cole-Adams of the <i>Age</i> stay. Whilst listening to the debate Jost
              tussles with the <i>Age</i> crossword. he doesnt have any trouble
              with two down: &quot;Underhand 4-3-6&quot;. Maybe the atmosphere
              helps.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; As the
              debate on wage indexation continues, Hawke lights up another
              cigar. John Halfpenny of the AMWU points out that, despite media
              misinterpretation, his union supports indexation, but not with
              strings and guidelines attached. He says that, whilst wage and
              salary earners are being told that they should be getting less
              today than yesterday, the directors of BHP see things differently.
              On september 23 they were considering an increase in directors
              fees from $45,000 to $60,000.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; When
              communist Halfpenny finishes, rightwinger John Ducker rises to say
              that the opportunity of supporting him in upholding wage
              indexation is too good to miss.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; The
              vital vote is taken and the Australian unions unanimously approve
              support for Whitlam's call for a policy of wage restraint. But
              they do leave an out to enable unions to seek overaward demands through industrial action and collective
              bargaining.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; They
              also flatly reject a resolution put up by the left which condemns
              any compulsory wage controls. Which might just help reinforce
              father's belief that he knows best.</font>
