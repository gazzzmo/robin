                <b><font face="Times New Roman" size="1">By ROBIN HOWELLS</font></b></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">WHENEVER the
                next federal elections are called Australia is likely to see a
                polarisation of the electorate unmatched since those wild
                meetings of the 1960s when Vietnam and conscription split
                siblings, saints and sinners.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                That was my main impression after just 15 minutes at the Liberal
                party rally at the Myer music bowl last sunday afternoon.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                When the contingent of over 200 ALP stirrers came striding down
                the slippery sloped lawn just as the meeting started you
                realised that at long last Malcolm Fraser had given them a cause
                to be genuinely concerned about. Starting with their big banner
                that said <i>Libs pack rape democracy</i> they made their
                presence prominent.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The crowd of around 12,000 was unusual, too. They were almost
                100 percent Liberal party supporters. You could identify them by
                their Liberal party tee-shirts, badges, balloons and stickers.
                There seemed to be almost no uncommitted members of the public
                along to hear Fraser.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Which was just as well, because from the moment Fraser tried to
                talk it was almost impossible to hear him. The heavy
                amplification couldnt match the fervour of the ALP stirrers
                shouting: &quot;One two three four, who do you think we're
                voting for? Five six seven eight, Fraser must capitulate&quot;
                and &quot;We want Gough, We want Gough&quot; over and over.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Posters held by the ALP supporters said <i>Hitler also claimed
                he had to do it. Save democracy; Gorton, then Snedden. Now he is
                prepared to stab Australia in the back in search of power;
                Fraser's stormtroopers threaten our democracy</i> and <i>Malignant
                Malcolm. Constitution's cancer</i>.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Then it was a switch to shouting <i>zieg heil</i> and giving
                Fraser the fascist salute. This riled many Liberal supporters
                and set off a series of minor scuffles and verbal jousts that
                kept feelings high through the rest of the rally.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Among the strongest supporters of the Liberals at the rally were
                groups with middle european accents who were obviously most
                concerned by the developing political crisis. They maintained an
                incredible tirade of insults and abuse aimed at the ALP
                stirrers.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Fraser was supported in his attempst to try to indicate a wave
                of public support for his actions by senator Margaret Guilfoyle,
                Doug Anthony and his permanent plastic smile, and Rupert Hamer
                looking rather dowdy in slacks, a dull jumper and a drab sports
                coat. Athol Guy, that amazing self-Seeking Liberal member of
                state parliament was responsible for the &quot;musical&quot;
                entertainment.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Phillip Lynch, Tony Staley, Peter Nixon, Andrew Peacock and
                Susan Peahen were also there to keep up the numbers. It was also
                reported that there were 140 members of the Victoria police in
                attendance.</font></p>

                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                George Cox, the Liberal candidate for the state seat of Deakin,
                left the meeting while his beloved leader was still trying to
                explain why he had to do it to revive Australia. By a strange
                quirk of fate I then went off to a rather interesting film
                called <i>Paper tiger</i>.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The next day didnt look like being a dull monday. To show
                support for the government the ALP had arranged at short notice
                a rally in the city square at 12.30 pm. By 12.15 the square was
                filling rapidly and it was notable that the audience wasnt just
                made up of obvious ALP supporters.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                They came out of shops and offices at lunchtime and they had an
                air of spontaneity about them. They didnt seem orchestrated and
                programmed in the way the Liberals did the day before.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Clyde Holding, Peter Redlich and senator Wheeldon warm the crowd
                up prior to Gough's appearance. Redlich raises hearty laughter
                from the square when he says: &quot;The people down near the <i>Fraser
                stinks</i> sign, can you hear me? And please keep the sign
                up.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Other signs refer to <i>Fraser political prostitute</i> and the
                S in Fraser is a swastika: <i>Mal, multinationals pal</i>; <i>The
                Spanish workers support Labor government</i>; <i>Stop
                Mal-practice</i> and <i>95 percent of Greeks support democratic
                stand of Australian government</i>.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                It's 12.30 now and the city square is packed with more than
                18,000 people. It's become such a crush that the crowd spills
                out to the middle of Collins street and the police are forced to
                divert westbound traffic around the block. In Swanston street
                the crowd is also taking over the road and trams are forced to a
                halt.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Gough arrives and is cheered so loud and long that the pigeons
                on the Melbourne town hall opposite increase their attempts to
                turn it white. Tickertape showers down on the square and Gough
                gets into his speech with gusto.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He
                makes it plain that Labor will not bow to opposition pressure
                for a house of representatives election. &quot;Your great
                response will ensure that government of the people, for the
                people, by the people's house will not disappear from this
                country,&quot; he says.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; In
                referring to the recent death of senator Milliner he makes great
                play of the fact that Fraser is trying to seize power over a
                dead man's body. Despite patchy rain and temporary trouble with
                the amplification system during the prime minister's address the
                crowd stays to hear every word.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; At
                the end of his address Whitlam is surrounded by wellwishers and
                he has a hell of a job to get back to his car. The crowd
                continues to follow his car up Swanston street and Melbourne
                staggers back to normal.</font></td>

        Note: Before the dismissal of the Whitlam Labor
        government by Sir John Kerr on November 11 1975, a wave of
        demonstrations and protests swept the country. Many Australians were
        angered by the flouting of convention by members of the Liberal
        opposition. They were refusing to approve the Budget sent to the Senate
        by the Labor government. This report was one of a number carried in a
        double page tabloid spread, which <b><i>Nation Review</i></b> ran to
        cover the reaction taking place.</font></p>
