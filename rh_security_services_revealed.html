        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">REVELATIONS
        of the clandestine behavior of Australia's security services were made
        by two witnesses at a remarkably unpublicised open hearing of the royal
        commission on intelligence and security in Melbourne this tuesday. The
        hearing was not advertised and the media were not notified it was being
        held.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        First witness to appear was K. J. Coldicutt, a teacher at a highly
        respectable Melbourne public school. Coldicutt told Mr justice Hope that
        when he was a student at Melbourne university he was active in the Labor
        club in the 1930s. Being concerned about the nazis and fascism he became
        secretary and editor of the club's magazine. In 1935 at the age of 20 he
        joined the university branch of the communist party and the Friends of
        the Soviet Union.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In december 1941 he enlisted in the RAAF and after training as a radio
        operator he was recommended for a commission. Then something strange
        happened and his commission didnt come through. A colleague from his
        university days who was a member of a services intelligence unit
        mentioned to Coldicutt that he had come across his name in an
        intelligence file because he had spoken at a meeting against the
        proposal for the army to take over a public park in South Yarra for army
        barracks.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        After his discharge in 1945 Coldicutt organised the Realist film unit
        which aimed to produce films of social value with the backing of trade
        unions and the communist party. He was also an early committee member of
        the Melbourne film society and took part in the organisation of the
        first film festival in Australia. When the Australian film board was
        being established he was approached about becoming a member. Later he
        was advised that he had been investigated by security in Canberra and
        his appointment to the board was blocked by ASIO.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        With the introduction of television to Australia in 1956 Coldicutt
        applied for a number of positions with the ABC. This was five years
        after he had left the communist party but it didnt seem to change his
        troubles with ASIO. He didnt get a job with the ABC and in 1961 he
        decided to test the measure of his competence by the commission. He
        became a stringer cameraman with ABC television on Australia day and the
        results went to air that night. Within a few days he had a contract with
        the ABC.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In the early 1960s he applied for a number of positions with the CSIRO
        film unit and was told that in view of his political attitudes ASIO
        wouldnt approve him being appointed.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Then came the mystery letter from the commonwealth government. Coldicutt
        said the letter carried the name of no government department and asked
        him to attend for an interview at a specific room number in the T&amp;G
        building in Collins street, Melbourne.</font> <font face="Verdana" size="2">When
        he went to the office it bore no name and contained only a desk and two
        chairs. The man sitting in one chair didnt introduce himself but got
        straight down to his spooky spiel. He asked Coldicutt if he was prepared
        to give information about the 100 or more people he knew in&nbsp;</font></td>

        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">the
        communist party. When Coldicutt refused he was given the impression that
        he could get a commonwealth job if he went along with these intimidatory
        tactics. The interview took almost an hour and it was made obvious that
        if he did not agree to supply information he would never get a job with
        the public service or CSIRO.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Coldicutt stated that he believed his evidence showed that
        discrimination exists against Australians because of political activity.
        He called for the abolition of security services involved in the
        collection of what should be private political information.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Dr Alan Patrick Roberts, a senior lecturer in the physics department at
        Monash university, was the next witness to appear. He told the royal
        commission that in 1957 he applied to the university of New South Wales
        for a lectureship in mathematics. At the time he was a member of the
        communist party. After not receiving any reply to his application he
        found out through a friend that the head of the mathematics department
        had written him a letter offering him the position. The department head
        was then told by a clerk that he had been instructed not to send a
        letter to Roberts offering him the job.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Dr Roberts told Mr justice Hope that he believed that the information
        leading up to these instructions were provided by ASIO.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        He also told of an earlier incident which took place in 1953 when he was
        teaching at an undisclosed grammar school. After he had been teaching
        mathematics for six months the head master told him that a member of the
        school council had said that he was a subversive. After the head master
        queried this allegation he was given the phone number of the local ASIO
        office.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Roberts said the head master spoke to ASIO and details of Roberts' ASIO
        dossier were read to him over the phone. The headmaster quoted details
        back to Roberts which convinced him that ASIO knew a great deal about
        him. The headmaster indicated his disdain for the ASIO witch hunt by
        keeping Roberts in his job. In case his ASIO file isnt up to date Dr
        Roberts told the royal commission that he was expelled from the
        communist party in 1960 for a number of reasons including the dreaded
        charge of factionalism.</font></td>

        Note: The original information about these unpublicised hearings by the
        Royal Commission appeared to come from a source within the Commission's
        staff. Allegations made by those appearing indicated some surprising
        behaviour by ASIO and its staff over decades. Justice Hope's report was
