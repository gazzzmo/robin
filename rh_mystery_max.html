                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">ONE
                OF this country's most incredible spy stories broke last weekend
                when Melbourne's <i>Sunday observer</i> carried headlines screaming: <i>ASIO's top agent
                exposes our amazing world of sex,
                treachery and terror.</i></font>

                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; This
                alleged top spy is 25 year old Czech born Maxmilian Weschler who
                says that he reached the exalted position in ASIO in 26 months
                and was being paid the amazing salary of $100 cash a week by
                them in addition to receiving $36 weekly in commonwealth sickness benefits.</font></p>

                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; How
                Mystery Max came to receive sickness benefits and what Max's
                sickness is are questions receiving scrutiny from people who've
                known Max and his medical history. The disclosures are expected
                to throw new light on the calibre of the informers and agents
                employed by ASIO.</font></p>

                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Max's
                deluded, dubious claim to fame is that he
                &quot;infiltrated&quot; two perfectly legal organisations - the
                Socialist Workers League and the Socialist Youth Alliance. As
                these two groups pointed out after Maxie's mumblings, they are
                both legal organisations; they campaign openly to win mass
                acceptance of their socialist aims; their objectives are openly
                stated in their publications such as the fortnightly <i>Direct
                action</i>.</font></p>

                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; What
                Mystery Max did do was to disclose that ASIO has continued to carry out harassment
                and secret surveillance of legal political organisations. ASIO filmed and spied on members of these groups.
                They also tapped the phone of the SWL Melbourne office.</font></p>

                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Maxie's standard of reporting to ASIO shows how unreliable most
                of their information could be. He said that the catholic church
                was the unwitting host to SWL members at its Ocean Grove
                complex. Yet this camp is owned by the methodists!</font></p>

                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He
                also claims to have used sex as a weapon in his
                &quot;spying&quot; adventures. Those who've known him well in
                the&nbsp;<br>

                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; A
                number of questions remain unanswered about Mystery Maxie.</font>

                    <img border="0" src="rh_bullet.jpg" width="8" height="8"> How could he
                    afford to move into the Centre City Club in Flinders street,
                    Melbourne and pay $37 weekly rent from december 5 last until
                    february 19?</font>
                    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img border="0" src="rh_bullet.jpg" width="8" height="8">
                    Where did he
                    obtain the money to buy a color TV? When questioned about it
                    by SWL members he said his aunt was feeling sorry for him
                    and gave him the money to buy it. He has since admitted that
                    another story about his aunt giving him money was a lie.</font>
                    <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img border="0" src="rh_bullet.jpg" width="8" height="8">
                    Was it
                    coincidence that he was at the City Centre Club at the same
                    time as runaway British MP John&nbsp;Stonehouse? In 1969 a Czech&nbsp;security agent&nbsp;
                    Joseph Frolik&nbsp; defected to the Americans and alleged that
                    Stonehouse was a Czech agent. This was investigated by British security service D15. They later
                    reported to Harold Wilson that Frolik's allegations were
                    without foundation</font>

                    How did
                    Mystery Max become naturalised in less than the three years
                    residence required to qualify? In one article he states he
                    arrived in Australia on june 7, 1969, in another he states
                    he was naturalised in late 1971. At press time the
                    immigration department in Canberra had not been able to
                    answer this paradox.</font>

                    of Czechoslovakia by an ASIO agent in Vienna who was posing
                    as a migrant selection officer?</font>
