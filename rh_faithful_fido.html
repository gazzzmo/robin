                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Log on to the
                National Bulletin Board and you will find it's the Australian
                gateway to the world's first bulletin board network, known as Fido Net.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Earlier this year, the National became the first Australian BBS
                to join the international FidoNet system.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &quot;Users are able to communicate with others from the US,
                Europe and UK, Indonesia and the Philippines, as well as all
                over Australia.&quot; says the National's sysop, John
                Blackett-Smith.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The FidoNet system is more than two years old, and has grown
                from an initial system of seven BBS members to an international
                network with a membership of more than 600. Most of this growth
                has been in the United States, but the heaviest use is in the
                Netherlands, where there is a large, active (and highly
                profitable) club running FidoNet. A smaller FidoNet runs in the
                UK and a couple of boards are linked in the Philippines and
                Indonesia.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The FidoNet system was written by Tom Jennings in America with a
                little help from some friends. In two and a half years he is
                already up to Version 11S. According to Blackett-Smith, FidoNet
                is two modules operating within the same program. The first is a
                local BBS, not unlike a number of those operating on various IBM
                PCs and compatibles, such as the Capitol IBBS or the Software
                Systems IBBS created by Gene Plantz (as used by PC Connection in
                Melbourne and the PC User Group in Sydney). Along with that</font>
                <font face="Verdana" size="2">is the FidoNet
                module, which allows a user on the National to leave a message
                for another user on, for example, a BBS in Ohio.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; At
                3 am New York time (6 pm in Melbourne), all the FidoNet systems
                around the world close down and start dialling each other.
                Occasionally they will receive an engaged signal and they skip
                to the next number. Using a complex algorithm developed by
                Jennings, they all eventually synchronise, and the entire
                operation takes about seven minutes.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Once synchronised, all messages are passed on to the other
                boards, and each board decodes its messages and adds them to its
                own message section</font></p>
              </td>
              <td valign="top" align="left" width="20"><img border="0" src="transbrd.gif" width="20" height="10"></td>
              <td valign="top" align="left" width="345">
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">just as if it had been entered by a local
                user. Apart from messages, FidoNet also transfers files and data
                for a newsletter that is circulated to all FidoNet sysops.
                Blackett-Smith claims that FidoNet is also being used in America
                by companies which have a need for a network but do not wish to
                go to the expense of installing a local area or remote network.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Following on from his role as the sysop for the National,
                Blackett-Smith is regional co-ordinator for FidoNet and is known
                officially as &quot;FIDO 1/1&quot; in Australia. Because it is a
                public domain program, it is free for non commercial use,
                provided no support is required. A nominal charge of $20 ensures
                support and upgrades. Charges for commercial users start at
                $100, and depend upon the level of support
                required.</font>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The National BBS is run on an IBM PC compatible, known as the
                Mac XT, which is imported by KCM Computers in Victoria. It has
                640K, two 360K disk drives, and NEC 10M hard disk, and a NetComm
                In/Modem is used to communicate with callers. Blackett-Smith
                started the National in August 1985 because he believes that
                those who are going to succeed in the future are the people who
                have an understanding of, and some control over, communications.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &quot;It seems that a lot of people are technology-shy, or
                afraid of the computer. One way of overcoming this and
                encouraging further use of data communications is a BBS,
                particularly if a number of them have a similar user
                interface,&quot; he says. &quot;People need to be comfortable
                shifting from one to the other, and that will further encourage
                the dissemination of information.&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; He
                rates the National as being an outstanding BBS success,
                averaging between 40 and 60 calls per day, despite the fact that
                it originally closed down between 9 am and 5 pm Monday to Friday
                so that he could use the line for his film and television
                production business.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                However, Blackett-Smith warns that only dedicated sysops should consider
                installing FidoNet, as he estimates that he has spent about 300
                hours in getting his system up and running, and fine-tuned into
                the BBS it is today.</font></td>
