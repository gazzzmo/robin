                ROBIN HOWELLS<br>
                in Melbourne</font></b></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">WITH THE
                release of a detailed content analysis of four Melbourne
                newspapers during the period november 12 to december 5, a
                Latrobe university research team led by Patricia Edgar has found
                evidence of serious bias in their coverage of the federal
                election campaign.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The study confirms that Gough Whitlam is correct in claiming
                that the press played down the ALP campaign. It also shows that
                Rupert Murdoch's statement that the <i>Australian</i> has
                &quot;gone to great lengths to keep the bias out of it and keep
                a fair and equal reporting, particularly in the <i>Australian</i>
                where there are many pages of reports every day, fair and equal
                to both parties&quot;, is not borne out by analysing the paper's
                editorial content.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; In
                carrying out the survey the team classified articles as being
                either favorable or unfavorable to the political party being
                discussed. No attempt was made to assess any sort of bias in
                reporting. Whenever there was any doubt about any article, or if
                it was thought it could be interpreted either way, the article
                was classified as &quot;neutral&quot;. Because of this, the team
                believes its analysis represents a conservative estimate of
                press favoritism.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; It
                looked at editorials, news reports, letters to the editor,
                commentaries and analyses by named journalists, non bylined news
                reports and pictures. It measured space in column centimetres
                and noted page location and the number of articles favorable to
                either party or neutral in content.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Assessing editorials, it found they revealed a strong anti Labor
                bias in all newspapers except the <i>Sun</i>. The <i>Sun</i>
                does not have a daily editorial, probably because they think
                their readers couldnt cope. In the <i>Age</i>, 54.15 percent of
                editorials on the election were unfavorable to Labor; 14.32
                percent unfavorable to the Liberal/NCP; and 24.49 percent
                neutral. The team notes with some irony that the only <i>Age</i>
                editorial favorable to Labor was printed the day after Whitlam's
                sacking.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The <i>Australian</i> and the <i>Herald</i> were more blatant in
                their bias than the <i>Age</i>. Neither had an editorial
                favorable to the ALP and, just to reinforce that the medium is
                the message, they managed to print no editorials unfavorable to
                the Liberals. Only two out of 23 editorials in the <i>Australian</i>
                were neutral, compared to four out of 11 in the <i>Herald</i>.
                It was also found that the <i>Australian</i> devoted nearly
                twice as much space as the <i>Age</i> to editorials and almost
                four times as much as the <i>Herald</i>.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Looking at analytical articles by news commentators it found the
                majority of articles in all four papers were neutral. In the <i>Age</i>
                neutral articles comprised 53.33 percent of the total, in the <i>Australian</i>
                65.22 percent, in the <i>Herald</i> 64.29 percent and in the <i>Sun</i>
                61.54 percent. However the <i>Australian</i>'s bias was really
                showing in the remaining 34.53 percent of commentators' articles
                which were either unfavorable to Labor or favorable to the
                Liberal/NCP. This contrasted with the other three papers where
                the remainder of their commentaries tended to favor Labor rather
                than Liberal.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                With political news reports by named journalists it was found
                that 40 percent in the <i>Age</i> favored Labor, 30 percent
                Liberal/NCP and 16.67 percent were neutral. In the <i>Australian</i>
                35.48 percent favored Labor and 12.91 percent Liberal, while
                35.48 percent were neutral. </font></td>

              <td valign="top" align="left" width="345">
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The contrast
                between the <i>Herald</i> and <i>Sun</i> is quite marked and may
                indicate one reason why the <i>Herald</i> continues to have
                circulation losses. In the <i>Herald</i> only 15.38 percent
                favored Labor and 38.46 percent favored Liberal, with 23.08
                percent neutral. In the <i>Sun</i> 37.5 percent favored Labor,
                12.5 percent favored Liberal and 37.5 percent were neutral. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
                it looked at political items by unidentified writers the Latrobe
                university media centre research team found a major contrast
                apparent between them and news reports by named journalists.
                This was most noticable in the <i>Australian</i> and appears to
                bear out the concern of working journalists on the <i>Australian</i>
                who struck this week because of alleged bias in the paper.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; Of
                the space given to political reports by unnamed journalists in
                all four newspapers, 44.7 percent of the total appears in the <i>Australian</i>.
                When these articles were analysed it was found that 25.55
                percent were unfavorable to Labor, while only 6.94 percent were
                unfavorable to the Liberals. Articles favorable to the Liberals
                comprised 26.64 percent while 15.32 percent favored Labor.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                The team points out how this contrasts with the 35.48 percent of
                the political news reports by named journalists in the <i>Australian</i>
                which favored Labor and only 12.9 percent which favored Liberal.
                It points out very coolly that this may reflect different views
                on the part of working journalists on the <i>Australian</i>
                compared with the views of their proprietor.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; In
                looking at page placement of articles the Latrobe university
                team points out a trap for the unwary. It says the pattern of
                positive emphasis towards Labor in the <i>Age</i>, for articles
                by named and unnamed journalists, has to be modified
                dramatically in the light of page placement.</font></p>
                <p align="center"><img border="0" src="rh_press_bias2.jpg" width="175" height="314"></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although
                quantitative evidence suggests that page placement does not
                favor either major party, they quote examples of articles on
                issues seen to be important in the campaign which suggest that
                qualitative analysis would show a different trend.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; It
                also draws attention to the problem of which news items are
                highlighted and which are not and points out that this is most
                evident in the survey where items of major importance are given
                low priority in terms of page placement and column centimetres.
                Other problem areas in the survey were with selective headlining
                and decisions regarding relative news worthiness of
                personalities or &quot;authorities&quot; who took sides in the
                electoral dispute.</font></p>
                <p align="justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;
                After giving a number of examples from papers of each problem
                area the report concludes on a sober note. It states that a
                thorough qualitative analysis would be needed to reveal the
                extent of the nature of bias in the press. However, it believes
                that the quantitative data in the report shows that the reading
                public should view press reports of the political campaign with
                scepticism.</font></td>
